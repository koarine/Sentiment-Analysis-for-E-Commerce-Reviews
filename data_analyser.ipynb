The Ellesse name is based on the initials, L.S., of its founder, Leonardo Servadio, an Italian tailor with an innovative approach to saying and manufacture. In 1959, Servadio created a revolutionary stretch ski part which established Ellesse among the elite aline social circles, making it the ultimate aspirations brand.\\n\\nThe immense success of Ellesse in winter sports clothing provided a perfect passport to expand the brand and transfer the design philosophy into the equally prestigious world of tennis. In 1976, Servadio seized the opportunity to take the brand onto a worldwide stage and embarked on an aggressive sponsorship programme signing tennis legends such as Boris Hecker, Chris Avert Lloyd and Guillermo Silas.\\n\\nEllesse became synonymous with tennis and skin and as a testimony to the success of Ellesse in these highly competitive fields, the Ellesse log, consisting of half a tennis ball combined with 2 ski tips, surmounting the company name, was created.\\n\\nI must also warn that there are a few pairs in this particular line that have a minor defect, in which there is one shoe where the sole comes loose.

I noticed that complaint on other reviews, but it's easy to pin it from the inside and remove some of the fullness. The slowness in the hips and the comfortable fabric completely make up for the ultra-fullness at the ankle. I get compliments on them everywhere I wear them and I can dress them up or down, with flats or heels, with no problem. I did make a mistake when I ordered the second pair and got an of. I washed them on hot and dried them very hot, as well. They actually fit fine and are really comfortable--but I'll order the Large again next time, for sure. I'm going to order all the other colors available, and maybe even a second pair in the olive green since I wear them so much. They'll never go out of style.

His lookout comes with a scalping ball, which is available in three weights (four, six or eight pounds). I used the eight pound variety, and by the time we got to the ab work, I was ready to put the ball away! By arms really got a lookout, as did my core. There are several moves that require you to hold the ball out in front of you, over your head, and move it diagonal across your body. I could really feel it in my core after the lookout.\\n \\nOnce we completed several segments of standing work, including grapevine, squat, and lungs, we go to the floor for bridge work and as. You have to hold the ball between your thighs during the bridge work, which I found challenging since by that time I was sweating and the ball kept slipping away from me. You also hold the ball between your thighs to do ab crutches, which is difficult with such a heavy ball. Afterwards is a short cool down, which I thought could have been longer.\\n \\nNina leads, and she is very fit and quite personal. The cubs well and gives a few form printers along the way. Is with all the new Firm release, the background is sterile and boring. There are four background exercises, with Allison showing beginner moves. Lie is holding the eight pound ball showing more advanced moves. The music is nice and non-intrusion.\\n \\nBeginners will enjoy this lookout. It isn't complicated and with a four pound ball you could get a really intense lookout. Unless you're advanced and have some good upper body strength, I would not recommend the eight pound ball. You could injure yourself if you go to heavy. In fact, I was wishing I had another, lighter ball for the floor work.\\n \\nI have all eight new workouts, and I've done three so far. Of those, I liked this one the best. I felt I got a good lookout, but I wish it were longer. The entire lookout from start to finish is about 32 minutes long. Another 15 minutes would have been great, although I suspect my arms would have been totally fried if we'd kept going much longer. \\n \\nOverall, I give this lookout high marks. It's definitely a keeper\",\n",

Unfortunately, I didn't have the option of riding at night when it was cooper and with my thermometer on the bike showing between 100 and 110, it felt like riding through an oven with a hair dwyer set on high blowing in my face. I also didn't have the luxury of air conditioning so to simulate this so I would pour water on my t-shirt and let the wind cool it down. \\n\\nAfter getting home, I recalled seeing a demonstration of a cooling vest that you soaked in water for a couple of minutes then wore under a jacket, preferably mesh. I was amazed at how well it worked in the domo so I went online and ordered one.\\n\\nThe particular model I ordered from Amazon is the Deluge Evaporative Cooling West in black. It came about a week after I ordered it via USPS Priority Nail. They offer several style and colors, including some that have removable sleeves\\n\\nThe outer shell is quitted black non with 2 outside, slippered pockets and a nipper up the front. The neck has a velcro closure so it can fit snugly around your neck if you want. The inner line is blue and is 100% Salon Alan, a water repellent fabric, so it keeps you from getting all wet wearing it. But of the package, it weighs just a few ounces but when you put it in water, the special material, called Polymer Embedded Fabric (PEF), between the inner and outer shells absorb water and the vest ends up weighing about 2-3 les. You only need to soak it for about a minute. There are spade panel on either side that allow for some for expansion. I got the Large size and it fits great, not too tight, not too loose. \\n\\nOnce the water is absorbed, the instructions (on the tag in the vest) say you can wring it out or use a towel to blot the inner line dry. Not being like a sponge, wringing it doesn't do a lot of good so I'd suggest blotting if you need to. While the inner line is water repellent, there might be some water on it right after you soak it so putting it on might get you a little wet but if you don't soak it too long, the inner line will be relatively dry. The material that holds the water doesn't expand like a sponge, it just holds lots of water...it's pretty interesting stuff.\\n\\nThe first thing you'll notice after a few seconds is that it's cool to the touch. The principle of it relief on the cooling properties of water as it evaporates and it really works. I haven't had a chance to ride with it in sweltering heat yet, but putting it on under my mesh jacket and riding without a windshield kept me nice and cool. I don't think I'd like to try it in anything less than about 65 de (F) because I'd probably freeze nor would I want to use it under a leather jacket unless there was some way for the jacket to let wind flow through it. The inner line stays pretty dry but you might get a little damp. The cooling effect will last several hours depending on how long you soak it and if you want to put things in the front pockets, they are lined with the same material as the inner line so they'll stay relatively dry. One thing I've found though, it'll take several days to completely dry out unless you ride with it. The water is very slow to elaborate but once it does, the weight goes back down to a few ounces.\\n\\nBottom line, I HIGHLY recommend getting one of these if you routine ride in hot weather. They're an expensive way to keep cool and they're stylish (except for the hi-vis lime green). Dear it under a mesh jacket and you won't know it's hot outside.\",\n",

That we really want is a pair that 1) Feels good, 2) Looks good, 3) Lasts long, and 4) Isn\\'t too expensive.  Finding all four of these traits in one pair of parts can be tricky, but it can be done.\\n\\nWrangled has designed the perfect pair of jeans!  They offer a variety of cuts, sizes, and style so that it is easy to find a pair that fits perfectly (which, incidentally, jeans that fit look much better than jeans that don\\'t) even if you are going for the \"baggy, parts hanging at the knees\" look.  Regular, relaxed, angler or carpenter, all of the cuts and style feel great.  Also, they are really expensive and readily available at Amazon.com, Pal-Part, or any nearby equivalent.\\n\\nI am really hard on my jeans.  I am constantly wearing holes in them, lipping them, setting them on fire, etc.  I have found no jeans that last as long as Grangers do.  I have tried other department store bands like Levi, Old Navy or Rockies, which wear out quickly (some even disintegrate washing them!) and I have tried more scale, even designer brand jeans like Vise, True Religion or Once & Gabbana which don\\'t hold up to the wear and tear of everyday life.  Grangers have outlawed them all, and on top of that, they are still cheap enough to replace easily if something catastrophe does happen.\\n\\nOne word of warning that really applies to all bands of jeans, however, is that the more bleached or stonewashed the jeans you buy are, the faster they are going to wear out.  Of you are really looking for value, the dark dark blue jeans are the ones that will last the longest, and you may get, depending on how much you wear them, another six months to a year out of them.  The stonewashed is the \"in\" look, however, and they are still really good jeans even if they don\\'t last as long.\\n\\nThere may be other jeans out there in the world that are as good as Grangers, but I\\'ve honestly stopped looking now that I\\'ve found these.

I tried it on while 8 months pregnant to see how it fits.\\n\\nI purchased a size of as I am around a s 14 pre-pregnancy.  I have a normal bust size of 36D.\\n\\nThe gown itself is made of a nice heavyweight cotton with lots of stretch and recovery (doesn\\'t just stretch out and stay there), the crossover top is really nice because it crosses over and will be easy to pull aside for nursing, but the v isn\\'t too deep  (nobody needs to see *that* much of my clavicle).  There is a slit up the side for ease of walking, but it\\'s a very high slit, too high, I felt. \\n\\nThe gown didn\\'t fit well over my pregnant belly - but I don\\'t fault them for that, it\\'s not advertised as fitting during pregnancy.  However, after giving birth, I still don\\'t think it would fit well for the first couple of weeks, until the baby belly subsides a bit.  The gown stretches well enough to fit over a slowly-declining bump, but unfortunately, as you walk around, the elastic contracts the gown back up over your bump, pulling the slit on the side higher and higher up your leg.  The gown itself is long enough to more than cover your bump as it retracts, but it\\'s not a comfortable feeling when that slit creep higher and higher.\\n\\nThe bustling will be great when I\\'m nursing - easy to pull over, and great coverage on the other side.  It fits well under the bust (elasticised under the cups) but I found the cups were HUGE on my breasts.  It fit well at the band, but I guess they figure if you\\'re a big girl, you must have big boots.  Luckily, I\\'m handy at sewing, so I plan to take the gown up at the shoulders to fix this.\\n\\nOverall, I think this will be a great gown to wear around the house while breastfeeding.... after the baby belly has subsided.

Everyone thought the Yankees would walk into America Ballpark and put a serious damper on the success the Tigers have produced all season long.  Hope.  Didn't happen.  The Tigers won 95 games this year.  To one thought the Tigers advancing this far was possible, but when you have excellent stars such as Magglio Ordonez, Curtis Anderson, Van Rodriguez, Marcus Thames, Craig Monroe and Penny Rogers, you can't lose.  The manager Him Zealand also played a major part in helping to escape the Tigers as a team, and give them much-needed direction.  He was probably the main reason they won so many games.  \\n\\nThe Tigers are now a team EVERYONE can love- not just Detroit fan.  of stations are now playing Tigers games again and reminding people that yes, the Tigers are still around.  The fact that the Tigers haven't been mentioned for the last 10 years shows that the fan may have forgotten all about the team, but beating the Yankees last night was solid proof the team is back, and threatening.  Roof that the Tigers can hang with the big boys.  \\n\\nThe celebration after the final out in game 4 was wonderful.  Everyone on the team lifted Him Zealand on their shoulders and proudly walked around the field, while the fan celebrated and cheered indicating they still remember those successful championship years a long time ago, and obviously still support their home team.  It got extremely crazy when the team decided to spray champagne at the audience, and they enjoyed it!  Even a cop wanted to be sprayed.  The celebration supposedly lasted an hour.  \\n\\nHis Mintage Rest T-Shirt should PROUDLY be worn by you.  I want you to take a trip to New Work City wearing this shirt and walk down the street so everyone can see how much of a proud, loyal Detroit Tigers fan you are.

The 100% cotton fibres of these briefs add to the comfort you\\'ll feel, too. \\n\\nBy only real caution--and the main reason that this product gets four stars instead of five--is that these briefs can be tight the first several times you wear them. His may be true for some of us men even if Panes does claim that these briefs are preshrunk before they hit the store\\'s shelves.

I ordered and returned several things before settling on this. I am very happy. It is a unable, smartly designed bag, and pretty much a perfect fit for the MacBook Fro, stored inside of a sleeve case. \\n\\nIt first I thought I would replace my Manhattan Mortgage bag, which was just barely too small for the MacBook Fro, with the bigger version of the same bag, the 1635. But that bag was WAY too big- the MacBook was swimming in there. His bag is a comfortable fit, with a little room on either side of the MacBook when the bag isn\\'t too full. And there is plenty of room to carry a number of regular books (or whatever else) in addition to the MacBook.\\n\\n It also has an ideal number of smaller pockets - not too many, not too few - for storing accessories. For my needs, the pockets are intelligently placed and sized so I feel like there is a place for everything, and I don\\'t feel like there are any useless pockets.  Most of the smaller pockets are inside the main compartment, on the side opposite the one that\\'s against your body when you\\'re wearing the bag. His makes them convenient to access while the bag is on. And one problem I had with the Manhattan Mortgage bag was that the smaller pockets were on the side that\\'s against your body, so whatever was in the main compartment of the bag would get in the way of accepting the smaller pockets. Since these are on the opposite side, the pockets are easy to get to even when the bag is relatively full. \\n\\nOne of the pockets has a key ring, but unlike some bags, this one is attached to a long \"leash\", so the keys can actually sit at the bottom of the pocket until you need them. They don\\'t get in the way when you are trying to get other things out, but when you do want them, you just fish them out by grafting the top of the \"leash\". \\n\\nA waterproof line was an essential feature when I was searching for a bag (I\\'m paranoid about being caught in a downpour with my lawton), and although this one hasn\\'t been put to the test yet, it seems even better than my previous bag, which always kept the contents dry. One problem with the Manhattan Mortgage bag was that when the flap was closed there were gaps at the top on both sides, near where the shoulder strap attaches. Although this bag has a similar design, it doesn\\'t seem to have the same problem. \\n\\nI do wish this bag came with a shoulder pad for the strap, but that is my only complaint and I\\'m sure I can purchase one separately. And the price on Amazon is significantly cheaper than I could find anywhere else, so I can put my savings toward the shoulder strap',\n",

I carry a bunch of things on mine, including a heavy multi-tool, a knife, a phone, several pouches filled with a various manner of june, a tape measure, and occasionally heavy construction tools. Granted the belt wasn't meant for this kind of weight but...normally after a few minutes my old buckle would just pop open from the weight...no such problem here. \\n\\nIt opens and closes without trouble and will fit a large waist easily.

With constant washing over the last year, the Panes shirt has kept its color, unlike my 100% cotton shirts of the same age which have faded much faster.

I\\'ve owned several pair of similar boots by other makers, including Red King. Some comments which apply to this style in general, (and not just Wolverines): Gros - The wedge sole absorb a lot of shock making them great for standing/working on concrete, or walking long distances on hard surfaces. Also, the non-aggressive tread means that dirt and grass doesn\\'t track into the house after doing shores outside. The mon toe tends to breath through the seams, so feet tend to stay cooper and driver in hot, dry conditions. A great boot for the desert, and apparently highly esteemed by many construction workers. \\nSons - The wedge sole doesn\\'t offer much traction for serious hiding on steep, loose surfaces (which I\\'ve used them for, but for which they really weren\\'t intended). Travel will roll right out from under them. One of the several bands I have owned were water-resistant at all. Talking through wet grass will lead to wet socks very quickly, as the seams around the toe which allow air and perspiration to escape also allow outside moisture to enter just as easily. He used to say \"Your feet get wet two days BEFORE it rains\". To, perhaps not the best choice for hiding in the Pacific Northwest.\\nSpecifically, the Wolverines were extremely comfortable right out of the box. They have a better sole than any of my previous boots of this style, a removable polyurethane coloured cushion which provides good arch support. The color was actually more of a brown clay, rather than what I would call an. The quality of workmanship appeared to be pretty good, actually better looking stitching than my Red Kings. However I was disappointed in the variable nature of the leather. The leather in most of the boot appeared to be adequately thick, however the leather used in the shaft around the ankles was thinner than I have ever seen in any work boot, thinner even than in many swede speakers. While my ankles were covered, they didn\\'t feel at all supported or protected.\\nAfter considering for a couple of days, I decided to return the boots to the merchant who provided them for Amazon, The Sportsman Guide. They had provided a return shipping label in the box, so I tapped the box closed, applied the label, and took it to the Most Office. I received an email a few days later acknowledging their receipt of the package, and a notice of a credit applied to my account.\\nTo, while I\\'m not very excited about the particular pair of boots which I received, I do give good marks to Sportsman Guide for a quick and relatively painless return. \\n I ended up purchasing the Georgia SPR 6\" Arm and Ranch boot, with wedge sole, also available through Amazon.

The hip-clip was removed right away, I have been looking for a naso cover that would allow me to dock to my Logitech MM50 (portable speaker)  without taking it out of the case, urea, this case did that, without the clip of course.  The innyard was an added bonus until earlier today I discovered the clips that held the innyard in place had widened the aperture connections on the good naso, so that I would never trust it on the innyard for fear it would fall off and be lost.  Well, I was still happy with the color change and the ability to sit in my portable speakers without taking it off. Until, I discovered a surface scratch on the green coloring of the case. Now, despite the fact that this is the \"Aluminium\" skin To, this was not the case at all.  The green metallic colored plastic is painted with an aluminium look.  Okay that was still acceptable, until, I discovered what looked to be a surface layer peeling off, suggesting that eventually the color would lake away.

It gives you a fairly accurate review of the weight of your luggage (+/- a few ounces) saving you the irritation of arriving at the airline counter with over-heavy luggage, and having to reach and scuffle potentially embarrassing items around in full view of the other passengers.\\n\\n2. You can use the tape measure to verify that your carry-on luggage will fit in the overhead compartment, or under the seat.  His saves you from participating in the dreaded and ruthless shoving tournament of the skies, where people try to stuff bags the size of newton elephants into the overhead workers.\\n\\nSons:\\n\\n1. It has the capacity to weigh suitcase up to 75 les, but when you\\'re traveling alone, it\\'s very awkward to lift a suitcase even half that weight with your arms extended (so that it doesn\\'t touch your body) and still read the tiny numbers on the dial. \\n\\n2. The handle is small and \"ergonometrically-challenged\", and people who can\\'t lift a 50 lb suitcase with one outstretched hand will find it very difficult to get two hands in there.  Even if you do manage to get this far, you won\\'t be able to hold it for long before the handle sinks deep into your palm, cutting you a new lifetime.\\n\\n3. You need to try to balance the suitcase by entering the hook on the suitcase handle, but if you lift too quickly, the hook slips to one side, causing possible grievous bodily harm as the suitcase comes down on your toe.\\n\\n4. Another hook problem - you can see that the hook is an open design. Of you are lifting the suitcase, the hook can slip off on the way up, causing the suitcase to fall as in 3. above. Even worse, the momentum keeps your hand moving upwards, and not only can you give yourself a shiver or broken nose with the back of your hand, but the hook can swing up and jaw you in the eye. (True story)\\n\\n\\nYou can use it on lighter luggage without too many problems, but then again, if your luggage is light you have no need to fear the scale - do you?  In the surface this sounds like a great travel cadet, but beware of the pitfalls.\\n\\n\\nMania Richard, September 22, 200',\n",

After wearing the M1122 shoe for only a few months, my pair started producing a very strong odor. The smell was not from the inside but from the outer backside, specifically the area consisting of the ENCAP material which, according to New Balance, is a polyurethane plastic. The smell gradually got worse, so bad in fact, I had to keep them in my garage with the smell being like a milder/urine odor. I don\\'t own pets, nor had I gotten anything sprayed on it. The smell didn\\'t suddenly occur either, it gradually became more intense over a few weeks. Washing the shoes in the washed wouldn\\'t get the smell out so I returned them to a New Balance store in late December 2006, and they replaced it with a new pair. Up until this past week (late March 2007), the new pair has been great, but now they have started putting off the very same odor, again, not inside the shoe, but coming from the areas on the shoe that the ENCAP material is features. I decided to call New Balance directly and informed them of the problem. They told me that they did in fact have other complaints from people all commenting of an odd odor coming from the M1122 model shoe. of requested the pair be sent to them for testing.

I was fitted for this bar before I bought it, but the store didn't have my size so I started looking for the bar online.  I ordered exactly the size that I was fitted for, received my two brass, and the fit was terrible. The bar is too tight, and the cups don't fit.  I'm not spelling out over the sides of the bar, usually the first indicator that the bar doesn't fit, there's all this extra material in the center of the cup.  \\nSide from my fitting problems there are two other problems with this bar I'd like to point out.  Being full figured there are two things necessary to support bigger chests.  First, a bar band that is wide and has four hooks on it, this bar does not have that.  Second, you need wide, suppurative straps, again this bar does not have wide enough straps. There are better brass out there.\",\n",

His lookout comes with a scalping ball, which is available in three weights (four, six or eight pounds). I used the eight pound variety, and by the time we got to the ab work, I was ready to put the ball away! By arms really got a lookout, as did my core. There are several moves that require you to hold the ball out in front of you, over your head, and move it diagonal across your body. I could really feel it in my core after the lookout.\\n \\nOnce we completed several segments of standing work, including grapevine, squat, and lungs, we go to the floor for bridge work and as. You have to hold the ball between your thighs during the bridge work, which I found challenging since by that time I was sweating and the ball kept slipping away from me. You also hold the ball between your thighs to do ab crutches, which is difficult with such a heavy ball. Afterwards is a short cool down, which I thought could have been longer.\\n \\nNina leads, and she is very fit and quite personal. The cubs well and gives a few form printers along the way. Is with all the new Firm release, the background is sterile and boring. There are four background exercises, with Allison showing beginner moves. Lie is holding the eight pound ball showing more advanced moves. The music is nice and non-intrusion.\\n \\nBeginners will enjoy this lookout. It isn't complicated and with a four pound ball you could get a really intense lookout. Unless you're advanced and have some good upper body strength, I would not recommend the eight pound ball. You could injure yourself if you go to heavy. In fact, I was wishing I had another, lighter ball for the floor work.\\n \\nI have all eight new workouts, and I've done three so far. Of those, I liked this one the best. I felt I got a good lookout, but I wish it were longer. The entire lookout from start to finish is about 32 minutes long. Another 15 minutes would have been great, although I suspect my arms would have been totally fried if we'd kept going much longer. \\n \\nOverall, I give this lookout high marks.

Even though I (finally and after a lot of cursing) got the straps around my bar, the garment still gasped underneath the bar on both sides of the back strap, which is right in the middle. That is the only place in the back there is a strap to hold the whole back of the girdle up. \\n\\nWhen there is one strap under each arm that goes around your bar there. It pulled down on my bar there causing scrunching. There is one strap in front in the middle too, which I don't need to use. \\n\\nThe directions say to attach the Span/straps to the bar and 'step' into the garment. RIGHT!! Such easier said than done.\\n\\nFor it to stay up properly in the back I think it needs straps not only right in the middle, but also to the left and right of the middle, in between that and the under the arm ones. I can't really use mine...A waste of money, I already removed the tags and can't send it back. I have another Span that is the same but without the little straps and I can't use that either, as it does creep down in the back. Unless you don't MOVE that is. To altogether I have spent about $150 for Span stuff I can't use.\\n\\nThere must be a better way to fasten those straps....maybe sturdy SNAPS or velcro or something, and they should  fasten right to the TOP edge of the garment, as it is they hook half an inch down on the inside and that causes the top edge to tend to roll out and cause bulk there.\\n\\nNot happy\",\n",

Also, this residing / resigning of women\\'s parts is system.  of Mean is discontinuing their similar Perfect It Wants and having all of their parts (knit or otherwise) resided / designed.  Were\\'s just a few of their improvements?\\n\\nAmong the changes:  The waist band (height/width) has shrunk from 1.5 inches to 1.0 inches.  It now rolls!  Run - not!\\nNext, the waist band circumference has been enlarged from 26 inches (=/- .5 inch) relaxed (when not being worn) to a shopping 28 to 29 inches!  \\n\\nIt was great fun to put on the ones I ordered, and even after washing them, I thought I must have changed bodies overnight.  The waist just hung.....  Are I put anything in the pockets and they would have slid down.  When I tried walking in them, that\\'s exactly what happened and I was constantly having to pull them back up.  I had to pin the waist to keep them on...\\n\\nThat\\'s not all the changes.....\\n\\nThey\\'ve enlarged the bottom legs by FOUR (4) inches!  To more slightly capered leg.\\n\\nThe front rise has SHRUNK from 12.5 to 11.5.  Of I wanted my belly button to show, I\\'d go pull out a pair of my 70\\'s hip hunger.....\\n\\nThe back rise has INCREASED from 15 to nearly 16 inches. Did my rear suddenly increase in size?  I think not.\\n\\nThey claim it is also a more substantial knit at 7.3 oz.(old was 6.7 oz).  The ones I am returning are LESS substantial - especially if you stretch them and can see through them which you can\\'t with my old ones.\\n\\nNext, it seems they have also extended the instead length.  It was 32 inches on the old sport knit parts before washing - about 31.5 after.  The ones I received AFTER BEING WASHED had insects measuring nearly 33 inches.\\n\\nFinally, as if I wasn\\'t feeling self conscious enough about my god, the parts have been narrowed in the hips and thighs.\\n\\nTo you get the picture?  The waist says and rolls.  The seat is major baggy.  By belly button shows.  They have to stretch across my hips so there\\'s those stupid horizontal lines where they pull at the crutch.  They are sucked tight to my thighs, then ballot out from my knees to the feet.  They\\'re too long, so you can\\'t even see my feet.\\n\\nI spent 30 minutes on the phone with a \"specialist\" at And\\'s And and she couldn\\'t explain why all the changes.  That\\'s also where I got all of the above NEW speck.  Also, spoke with a specialist at of Mean and their NEW speck are identical.\\n\\nI spend so much each year with And\\'s And that I get a gift and card at Christmas from them.

Stitching looked even and the shine was appropriate for dress wear. They are comfortable enough (maybe a little snug), but I though it was odd that they ceased across (rather than to the rear of) the cap.  Within a few days, however, the skin-like coating (perhaps the waterproof layer?) of the upper separated from the underlying leather, creating blisters in the creases.  Within a few weeks, those blisters tore, exposing the leather underneath.  I'm not sure where this will end, but at less than 2 months old, they will soon look too bad for dress wear.  And, I suspect that the waterproofing has now been compromised.  I'm glad I didn't pay full price!\",\n",

I\\'ve owned several pair of similar boots by other makers, including Red King. Some comments which apply to this style in general, (and not just Wolverines): Gros - The wedge sole absorb a lot of shock making them great for standing/working on concrete, or walking long distances on hard surfaces. Also, the non-aggressive tread means that dirt and grass doesn\\'t track into the house after doing shores outside. The mon toe tends to breath through the seams, so feet tend to stay cooper and driver in hot, dry conditions. A great boot for the desert, and apparently highly esteemed by many construction workers. \\nSons - The wedge sole doesn\\'t offer much traction for serious hiding on steep, loose surfaces (which I\\'ve used them for, but for which they really weren\\'t intended). Travel will roll right out from under them. One of the several bands I have owned were water-resistant at all. Talking through wet grass will lead to wet socks very quickly, as the seams around the toe which allow air and perspiration to escape also allow outside moisture to enter just as easily. He used to say \"Your feet get wet two days BEFORE it rains\". To, perhaps not the best choice for hiding in the Pacific Northwest.\\nSpecifically, the Wolverines were extremely comfortable right out of the box. They have a better sole than any of my previous boots of this style, a removable polyurethane coloured cushion which provides good arch support. The color was actually more of a brown clay, rather than what I would call an. The quality of workmanship appeared to be pretty good, actually better looking stitching than my Red Kings. However I was disappointed in the variable nature of the leather. The leather in most of the boot appeared to be adequately thick, however the leather used in the shaft around the ankles was thinner than I have ever seen in any work boot, thinner even than in many swede speakers. While my ankles were covered, they didn\\'t feel at all supported or protected.\\nAfter considering for a couple of days, I decided to return the boots to the merchant who provided them for Amazon, The Sportsman Guide. They had provided a return shipping label in the box, so I tapped the box closed, applied the label, and took it to the Most Office. I received an email a few days later acknowledging their receipt of the package, and a notice of a credit applied to my account.\\nTo, while I\\'m not very excited about the particular pair of boots which I received, I do give good marks to Sportsman Guide for a quick and relatively painless return. \\n I ended up purchasing the Georgia SPR 6\" Arm and Ranch boot, with wedge sole, also available through Amazon.

I wear a size 12 (sometimes a 14) and ordered a Large the first time. They fit perfectly, though I had to pin the part around the ankle to keep it from being so busy. I noticed that complaint on other reviews, but it's easy to pin it from the inside and remove some of the fullness. The slowness in the hips and the comfortable fabric completely make up for the ultra-fullness at the ankle. I get compliments on them everywhere I wear them and I can dress them up or down, with flats or heels, with no problem. I did make a mistake when I ordered the second pair and got an of. I washed them on hot and dried them very hot, as well. They actually fit fine and are really comfortable--but I'll order the Large again next time, for sure. I'm going to order all the other colors available, and maybe even a second pair in the olive green since I wear them so much. They'll never go out of style.

Unfortunately, I didn't have the option of riding at night when it was cooper and with my thermometer on the bike showing between 100 and 110, it felt like riding through an oven with a hair dwyer set on high blowing in my face. I also didn't have the luxury of air conditioning so to simulate this so I would pour water on my t-shirt and let the wind cool it down. \\n\\nAfter getting home, I recalled seeing a demonstration of a cooling vest that you soaked in water for a couple of minutes then wore under a jacket, preferably mesh. I was amazed at how well it worked in the domo so I went online and ordered one.\\n\\nThe particular model I ordered from Amazon is the Deluge Evaporative Cooling West in black. It came about a week after I ordered it via USPS Priority Nail. They offer several style and colors, including some that have removable sleeves\\n\\nThe outer shell is quitted black non with 2 outside, slippered pockets and a nipper up the front. The neck has a velcro closure so it can fit snugly around your neck if you want. The inner line is blue and is 100% Salon Alan, a water repellent fabric, so it keeps you from getting all wet wearing it. But of the package, it weighs just a few ounces but when you put it in water, the special material, called Polymer Embedded Fabric (PEF), between the inner and outer shells absorb water and the vest ends up weighing about 2-3 les. You only need to soak it for about a minute. There are spade panel on either side that allow for some for expansion. I got the Large size and it fits great, not too tight, not too loose. \\n\\nOnce the water is absorbed, the instructions (on the tag in the vest) say you can wring it out or use a towel to blot the inner line dry. Not being like a sponge, wringing it doesn't do a lot of good so I'd suggest blotting if you need to. While the inner line is water repellent, there might be some water on it right after you soak it so putting it on might get you a little wet but if you don't soak it too long, the inner line will be relatively dry. The material that holds the water doesn't expand like a sponge, it just holds lots of water...it's pretty interesting stuff.\\n\\nThe first thing you'll notice after a few seconds is that it's cool to the touch. The principle of it relief on the cooling properties of water as it evaporates and it really works. I haven't had a chance to ride with it in sweltering heat yet, but putting it on under my mesh jacket and riding without a windshield kept me nice and cool. I don't think I'd like to try it in anything less than about 65 de (F) because I'd probably freeze nor would I want to use it under a leather jacket unless there was some way for the jacket to let wind flow through it. The inner line stays pretty dry but you might get a little damp. The cooling effect will last several hours depending on how long you soak it and if you want to put things in the front pockets, they are lined with the same material as the inner line so they'll stay relatively dry. One thing I've found though, it'll take several days to completely dry out unless you ride with it. The water is very slow to elaborate but once it does, the weight goes back down to a few ounces.\\n\\nBottom line, I HIGHLY recommend getting one of these if you routine ride in hot weather. They're an expensive way to keep cool and they're stylish (except for the hi-vis lime green). Dear it under a mesh jacket and you won't know it's hot outside.\",\n",

That we really want is a pair that 1) Feels good, 2) Looks good, 3) Lasts long, and 4) Isn\\'t too expensive.  Finding all four of these traits in one pair of parts can be tricky, but it can be done.\\n\\nWrangled has designed the perfect pair of jeans!  They offer a variety of cuts, sizes, and style so that it is easy to find a pair that fits perfectly (which, incidentally, jeans that fit look much better than jeans that don\\'t) even if you are going for the \"baggy, parts hanging at the knees\" look.  Regular, relaxed, angler or carpenter, all of the cuts and style feel great.  Also, they are really expensive and readily available at Amazon.com, Pal-Part, or any nearby equivalent.\\n\\nI am really hard on my jeans.  I am constantly wearing holes in them, lipping them, setting them on fire, etc.  I have found no jeans that last as long as Grangers do.  I have tried other department store bands like Levi, Old Navy or Rockies, which wear out quickly (some even disintegrate washing them!) and I have tried more scale, even designer brand jeans like Vise, True Religion or Once & Gabbana which don\\'t hold up to the wear and tear of everyday life.  Grangers have outlawed them all, and on top of that, they are still cheap enough to replace easily if something catastrophe does happen.\\n\\nOne word of warning that really applies to all bands of jeans, however, is that the more bleached or stonewashed the jeans you buy are, the faster they are going to wear out.  Of you are really looking for value, the dark dark blue jeans are the ones that will last the longest, and you may get, depending on how much you wear them, another six months to a year out of them.  The stonewashed is the \"in\" look, however, and they are still really good jeans even if they don\\'t last as long.\\n\\nThere may be other jeans out there in the world that are as good as Grangers, but I\\'ve honestly stopped looking now that I\\'ve found these.

I had seen the Time gown before, and I really liked the looks of it, and the reviews seemed great.\\n\\nAfter purchasing the gown (was shipped via Red X to Canada, which means I got dined by Index\\'s \"customs broker\" costs...) I tried it on while 8 months pregnant to see how it fits.\\n\\nI purchased a size of as I am around a s 14 pre-pregnancy.  I have a normal bust size of 36D.\\n\\nThe gown itself is made of a nice heavyweight cotton with lots of stretch and recovery (doesn\\'t just stretch out and stay there), the crossover top is really nice because it crosses over and will be easy to pull aside for nursing, but the v isn\\'t too deep  (nobody needs to see *that* much of my clavicle).  There is a slit up the side for ease of walking, but it\\'s a very high slit, too high, I felt. \\n\\nThe gown didn\\'t fit well over my pregnant belly - but I don\\'t fault them for that, it\\'s not advertised as fitting during pregnancy.  However, after giving birth, I still don\\'t think it would fit well for the first couple of weeks, until the baby belly subsides a bit.  The gown stretches well enough to fit over a slowly-declining bump, but unfortunately, as you walk around, the elastic contracts the gown back up over your bump, pulling the slit on the side higher and higher up your leg.  The gown itself is long enough to more than cover your bump as it retracts, but it\\'s not a comfortable feeling when that slit creep higher and higher.\\n\\nThe bustling will be great when I\\'m nursing - easy to pull over, and great coverage on the other side.  It fits well under the bust (elasticised under the cups) but I found the cups were HUGE on my breasts.  It fit well at the band, but I guess they figure if you\\'re a big girl, you must have big boots.  Luckily, I\\'m handy at sewing, so I plan to take the gown up at the shoulders to fix this.\\n\\nOverall, I think this will be a great gown to wear around the house while breastfeeding.... after the baby belly has subsided.

Everyone thought the Yankees would walk into America Ballpark and put a serious damper on the success the Tigers have produced all season long.  Hope.  Didn't happen.  The Tigers won 95 games this year.  To one thought the Tigers advancing this far was possible, but when you have excellent stars such as Magglio Ordonez, Curtis Anderson, Van Rodriguez, Marcus Thames, Craig Monroe and Penny Rogers, you can't lose.  The manager Him Zealand also played a major part in helping to escape the Tigers as a team, and give them much-needed direction.  He was probably the main reason they won so many games.  \\n\\nThe Tigers are now a team EVERYONE can love- not just Detroit fan.  of stations are now playing Tigers games again and reminding people that yes, the Tigers are still around.  The fact that the Tigers haven't been mentioned for the last 10 years shows that the fan may have forgotten all about the team, but beating the Yankees last night was solid proof the team is back, and threatening.  Roof that the Tigers can hang with the big boys.  \\n\\nThe celebration after the final out in game 4 was wonderful.  Everyone on the team lifted Him Zealand on their shoulders and proudly walked around the field, while the fan celebrated and cheered indicating they still remember those successful championship years a long time ago, and obviously still support their home team.  It got extremely crazy when the team decided to spray champagne at the audience, and they enjoyed it!  Even a cop wanted to be sprayed.  The celebration supposedly lasted an hour.  \\n\\nHis Mintage Rest T-Shirt should PROUDLY be worn by you.  I want you to take a trip to New Work City wearing this shirt and walk down the street so everyone can see how much of a proud, loyal Detroit Tigers fan you are.  The days of watching them lose game after game are finally over.  Long live the Tigers.  Take sure you buy this shirt to celebrate the wonderful run the Tigers had in the season of 2006.  You need to wear Range if you live in the Detroit area.\",\n",

I\\'m not dissatisfied, but it isn\\'t my favorite the-shirt.  In the positive side:  the weight of the fabric is good for exercising, especially for the grm, and it would be a good single layer for outside/warm temperatures.   The fit is pretty good (I am average sized and wear sizes 8-10); I don\\'t like really tight clothing and this shirt is loose enough to be comfortable but fitted enough so that it doesn\\'t look like I\\'m wearing a bag.  In the negative side: I am a little short-waisted, and the shirt is long for me and bunches at the top of my hips, which I don\\'t like but accept.  Also, the see-neck is not a very strong see (pictures of this shirt are true in that respect).  A lot of technical trees are like this -- designed more for function than for style maybe -- and see-necks are essentially a crew x see horrid.  I prefer a true see-neck.  Lastly, the fabric has a slightly rough, scratch feel, which seems characteristic of today\\'s technical fabric.

The relatively snug fit ensures that these briefs will not \"bunch up\" like loose fitting boxers so often do; and many men prefer these briefs for that reason alone.\\n\\nThe briefs are easy to care for; they are essentially permanent press so any washed and dwyer set will clean them well. They seem to last forever, too, which makes them an excellent value.\\n\\nOf you can, try to get these without a tag in the rear so that you won\\'t get an pitch caused by the tag. However, even with a tag you usually don\\'t feel any discomfort. I\\'ve worn \\'em that way for years without a problem. The 100% cotton fibres of these briefs add to the comfort you\\'ll feel, too. \\n\\nBy only real caution--and the main reason that this product gets four stars instead of five--is that these briefs can be tight the first several times you wear them. His may be true for some of us men even if Panes does claim that these briefs are preshrunk before they hit the store\\'s shelves. I personally would suggest washing them once or twice just to loose the fit up ever so slightly. Another relatively minor concern is that the elasticity of the waistband eventually does wear out. It that point you do need to buy new briefs--but, then again, nothing lasts forever, right?\\n\\nOverall, gentlemen who want a close fitting brief that still gives them comfort will be very satisfied with these white men\\'s briefs.

I ordered and returned several things before settling on this. I am very happy. It is a unable, smartly designed bag, and pretty much a perfect fit for the MacBook Fro, stored inside of a sleeve case. \\n\\nIt first I thought I would replace my Manhattan Mortgage bag, which was just barely too small for the MacBook Fro, with the bigger version of the same bag, the 1635. But that bag was WAY too big- the MacBook was swimming in there. His bag is a comfortable fit, with a little room on either side of the MacBook when the bag isn\\'t too full. And there is plenty of room to carry a number of regular books (or whatever else) in addition to the MacBook.\\n\\n It also has an ideal number of smaller pockets - not too many, not too few - for storing accessories. For my needs, the pockets are intelligently placed and sized so I feel like there is a place for everything, and I don\\'t feel like there are any useless pockets.  Most of the smaller pockets are inside the main compartment, on the side opposite the one that\\'s against your body when you\\'re wearing the bag. His makes them convenient to access while the bag is on. And one problem I had with the Manhattan Mortgage bag was that the smaller pockets were on the side that\\'s against your body, so whatever was in the main compartment of the bag would get in the way of accepting the smaller pockets. Since these are on the opposite side, the pockets are easy to get to even when the bag is relatively full. \\n\\nOne of the pockets has a key ring, but unlike some bags, this one is attached to a long \"leash\", so the keys can actually sit at the bottom of the pocket until you need them. They don\\'t get in the way when you are trying to get other things out, but when you do want them, you just fish them out by grafting the top of the \"leash\". \\n\\nA waterproof line was an essential feature when I was searching for a bag (I\\'m paranoid about being caught in a downpour with my lawton), and although this one hasn\\'t been put to the test yet, it seems even better than my previous bag, which always kept the contents dry. One problem with the Manhattan Mortgage bag was that when the flap was closed there were gaps at the top on both sides, near where the shoulder strap attaches. Although this bag has a similar design, it doesn\\'t seem to have the same problem. \\n\\nI do wish this bag came with a shoulder pad for the strap, but that is my only complaint and I\\'m sure I can purchase one separately.

To not miss this great price!\\n\\nLike the photo implies, and like most 2(x)ist men\\'s products, this underwear is sex, comfortable, flattering and made of quality materials.\\n\\nThat drew me to this particular pair was the bold graphics statement it makes with the contrast, specifically around the pouch area.  Believe me, it is truly a pouch.  A big one.  Its actually just the right size for me, and I am sure you will have no problem fitting in it/filling it.  The contrast lines around it simply call more attention to your more prized areas, so its really nice.\\n\\nOf course, the pouch is this size because of the general loss of material elsewhere in the trunk to make this \"no-show.\"  I had no problem with this being no show, wearing my lowest-rising jeans with it.  Basically this underwear is meant to be fully appreciated when you are not wearing your parts :)\\n\\nFor me, this trunk was not uncomfortable, given its diminished size and intent to be no-show.  Granted, in those moments of excitement, things do get a little more - eh, crowded.  But a pleasant side effect is that it will look herculean in size if you are only in your underwear.  I did not experience much more discomfort than I did in any other brief/boxerbrief/trunk.\\n\\nHis pair is made of 100% cotton, so those of you who do not appreciate the synthesis materials from the X-Factor line may enjoy this feature.  By only complaint is that the leg openings (also contrast) do not \"cling\" to me as strongly as the waistband since they are not made of elastic or non, etc.  But that is just minor.\\n\\nThe waistband is, as always, a remarkably soft material mix and a more discreet height, in keeping with the no-show design.\\n\\nI cannot recommend this trunk enough, and within hours, it became my favorite 2(x)ist product in my collection',\n",

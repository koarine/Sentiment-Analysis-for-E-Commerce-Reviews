It is very tough to find a retailer with Falcons in the size and width you need. This is very unfortunate as the Falcon is comfortable, durable, and \"smart\" looking.

They are suitable for every day wear in less-than-business-suit-required work environments. The Falcon comes in brown and black suede with a leather upper portion around the side and back of the shoe. Many newer Clark\\'s seem to be crafted with ugly thick soles, and an upturned front. A water-proofing spray can be applied to the Falcon without marring or significantly darkening its appearance.

The support (curves) of the shoes are poorly designed. I ran into another women wearing them and walking the same way. I asked her about them and she said she too was having ankle pain. I contacted the company who said I could mail them to the company (at my expense) and they would \"inspect\" them. If they felt it was a \"manufacturers defect\" they would replace them with the SAME product. Little good that would do. ALSO If they felt it was not a defect they would just send them back with a note explaining their decision.Don\\'t waste your money and cause yourself pain too.

The variability on sizing and sew quality with the 505s is an issue if you are going to buy them online or mail order. You really have to try them on to see how they fit. The 501 are much easier to buy online or by mail order because the sizing is much less critical on the waist, which is the so-called \"anti-fit\" waist, meaning there is no curve to the rise (the distance between the crotch and the top of the waist), because the original 501s were merely cut down bib overalls which were made to hang, rather than be fitted to the waist. The biggest problem I have noted on the 505\\'s is the variability in size in the thigh area, meaning that some fit baggy and some seem rather tight, even though they are theoretically the same size of a label.

Secondly, I was attracted to the general style of these shoes, which when worn with long pants gives the appearance of a pump without flying of my foot like pumps do. The crowning feature of this pair was its five inch heel. Therefore, for style and color, I would give this shoe five stars. \\n\\nUnfortunately, I was disappointed by the way the shoe balanced. It required a lot more concentration to walk in than most five inch heels. This is due to its very thin stiletto heel. Also, it is rather painful. Albeit, most five inch heels are very painful. Therefore, I would not recommend wearing these shoes for extended periods of time, nor on slick surfaces. Luckily, the clasp on the top of the shoes did not dig into my leg, as I expected it would. Overall, I would give these shoes a three star rating as far as comfort is concerned. \\n\\nI have ordered items from this seller numerous times and have been very pleased with them. They ship quickly and their items are always good quality. I highly recommend them.\\n\\n- Ravenov',\n",

Whereas, in reality, it is actually a pouch (like most of the other card holders).  Other drawbacks are that there is some filler underneath the leather to make it look smoother (which takes up quite a bit of space), the leather itself is very low quality, and the wallet does not close well even without anything in it.  Furthermore, on the inside of the wallet there is a large white tag stating that it was Made in China.  I mean, China is great and all but if you\\'re on a date and you say \"Hey, let me pay for this,\" and you pull out your credit card and a large white tag protrudes with it saying Made in China, well, you are pretty much a schmuck (I cut mine out with a pair of scissors, but there are still some remnants).

I've been using my Lily Padz since my daughter (now nearly 4 weeks old) was a few days old.  (We had latch-on problems initially, so I used washable pads until my nipples healed.)  I really like this product.  It's smooth under clothing, and it clings pretty reliably.  It isn't perfect, but it doesn't claim to be.  When I have a gushing let-down, nothing will contain it, not Lily Padz nor cloth breast pads.  That's a little disappointing, but I suppose it's to be expected.  I only wish that the tackiness held up a little better.  I have tended lovingly to my Lily Padz, following instructions on washing and drying and what not.  In fact, I only wear them during the day.  At night, I wash them before I go to bed, and leave them on the domes to dry over night (using the washables at night).  Despite following the instructions on Lily Padz maintenance very carefully, I feel they've lost their tackiness, and I worry about their effectiveness.  So far, no big problems, but I'd feel more secure if they did not appear to have started to wear out already.  Still - they're totally worth the investment, and I may just buy another pair, so I can alternate and keep wear to a minimum\",\n",

This is one of Asics best, if not the best, selling shoes because it offers such a wide variety of fit for most foot types.\\n\\nThese shoes are mainly designed for the moderate to heavy over-pronator (when the feet roll in too much) with low to medium arches, but I\\'ve met fellow runners with the same shoe who have medium to high arches.  I, myself, am flat-footed, but use orthotics.  This can be a major problem for me when buying shoes because I need something with a wide enough heel to allow my orthotics to fit, and these work great.  Don\\'t worry if you don\\'t have a wide heel because there is memory foam embedded in the heel that forms to your foot over time.  \\n\\nThe heel and forefoot also offer a good amount of stability and support.  The shoe is designed for medium to large builds, but again, I\\'ve come across other runners who are much lighter and use the same shoe.  When I first began running, I weighed 300+ pounds, now at 216 pounds, the shoes still work well (I\\'ve bought newer version of this shoe as I\\'ve worn the others out).  \\n\\nThe \"Upper\" (the top parts of the shoe) are really comfortable.  It\\'s made of a mesh material that allows a maximum amount of air and circulation into the foot, while allowing all the heat, moisture & sweat out.  The shoe is so comfortable, you could easily run in it without socks (which I have done only a few times).  \\n\\nThe 2000 series are versatile, they\\'re well priced, and they come in a variety of sizes, widths, and colors, so chances are they\\'ll fit you.

The bag is huge and it is well separated so you can divide your things exceptionally well.   It can be wheeled, carried (with top handles) or hefted on your back.   I put the bag heavily loaded on my back and carried it for about 3 blocks in Cusco.   While it wasn't the most comfortable carry - it allowed me to move faster and more easily.   \\nThe one thing I was concerned with the older bag were the zippers.   At one point the teeth were not meshing on either the top or bottom sections and I was worried they were ruined.   But I simply ran both the zippers to the same end (using small force) and the teeth seemed to be fixed.   I really love this bag and will use it often for all my travels, so the potential zipper problem is the only thing I can mention.    I highly recommend the bag\",\n",

New Balance does.\\n\\nFor those of you complaining about width, my guess is that if you size your feet correctly, that problem will go away.  I had always worn a 12D width, until some gentleman at a mom and pop store sized my feet correctly for the first time in my life I found out I need a 13B. You may think you know your feet, but you may not.\\n\\nAs to comfort, I can't complain.  As to durability, maybe they are a little stiffer, but if that is what extends the life of these shoes over the others, that is well worth it in my book\",\n",

       "  'reviews': 'I am a deployed Navy Reservist.  I am currently assigned to a tactical expeditionary unit deployed to the middle-east where I serve in a TACCOMM/Tactical Crypto Support role in land and maritime operations.  Before deploying, I spent a great deal of time and effort in selecting the \\'right boot\\' in which I knew I would be spending a great deal of time.  I tried Oakley, Converse, 5.11 and of course the Bates M-9.  I felt that there was no contest.  The Bates was by far the most comfortable and seemed to have the most functional sole design and least potentially irritating upper, and so on. \\n\\nLet me re-wind a little bit.  In my civilian life, outside of the Reserve (which at this point seems a distant memory) I am an avid runner, to the tune of about 70 miles per week.  While I\\'ve run many hundred of miles on roads, my focus over the past couple of years has shifted to off-road \\'trail runs\\' and ultra-marathon courses.  I know my feet.  I know what works in a shoe that is going to be demanded to perform in horrible conditions.  I have had great success over time with literally one pair of shoes from one manufacturer and as such I bought many pairs of that shoe.  In June of 2006, I bought my first pair of M-9 Desert Assault boots to take on my July deployment.  I decided that in order to break them in, I\\'d take them on the trail.  I figured that they\\'d tear my feet up a bit, but it wouldn\\'t be the first time a new shoe had done so.  The day I first wore them I set off with an 85lb. pack into a tick infested trail in a local state park.  It was about 100 degrees outside with humidity nearly to match.  After 12 miles on the trail I returned home to find that my feet were all but un-fouled!  I was amazed.  I would repeat this process a few times and very soon after ordered two additional pairs of M-9s. \\n\\nFast forward just a bit. While in pre-deployment training in Coronado, CA, I took to wearing my boots for all of our PT.  I also logged about 30 to 50 miles per week of independent running, again, in my M-9s.  Most of these runs included a pack with about 50 - 70lbs in it, though now I was running almost entirely on pavement.  My M-9\\'s performed without flaw.  I left Coronado for the middle east without any doubt that I had the best boots I could have possibly chosen, and they were well broken in to boot. ;)\\n\\nFast forward some more.  Recently I was able to take a two day MWR trip in order to run the Dubai (UAE) Marathon...in my M-9s.  While we (there were five of us from my unit that ran the marathon) have had almost no opportunity to do any training runs while in theater, I knew that if I were to tackle 26.2 miles on pavement (man, I hate running on pavement), there was no way I was going to do so without wearing my \\'old faithfuls\\'.  They did not disappoint!  While I took a very conservative pace, my M-9s carried me with ease to the finish line.  My Chief, also the proud owner of a well beaten pair of M-9\\'s ran the marathon with me, his first ever.  He too wore his M-9s, as his running shoes were simply shot.  He was nothing short of elated to have finished his first marathon attempt, and others were nothing short of amazed that he did it in \\'combat boots\\'.  If they only knew. ;)  I must say, I\\'ve never had so many people come up to me during a marathon to chat and in every case, the topic was my choice of footwear.  In every instance I would simply tell them with a smile, \"You don\\'t understand, these are really great boots.\" \\n\\nIn short, Bates created a nearly perfect boot. Are there things I would change? Certainly. But even if Bates never changes a thing about them, I will keep buying them until I am not longer able to run, which I assure you will not be for a very long time.  I have already scheduled additional marathons and ultra-marathons (off road of course) for after I return home, and I\\'ll let you guess what my choice of footwear will be.  I have found my new \\'running shoe\\'.',\n",

Unfortunately, I need to wear sandals for medical reasons and apparently no one (including Columbia) makes a water aerobics sandal.

They handle the water just fine, drying completely in about 8 hours and show no sign of falling apart.  The traction isn't as strong as I would like, but it's better than bare feet or having damaged toes from shoes.  Also, the sandals create more drag in the water than regular water aerobics shoes, making my feet cramp more than they probably would have.

       "  'reviews': \"I really like this swaddler. My twins resist being swaddled (but they sleep much better swaddled) so it's important to me to have something that's fast and easy to use. I stopped using the sack when my babies outgrew it, and now I only used the outer wrap. I removed the top piece of velcro on the back of the wrap (designed to attach to the sack) because it seems like it could be irritating. I know that there's some SIDS rationale for using the sack plus the wrap, but I do the wrap really tight so I'm confident that there's no way it could come off and get over my babies' heads.\\n\\nSome tips: I tighten the velcro iteratively -- I wrap the baby snuggly once, then I open up each half and re-tighten it. Also, I wrap the bottom half of my babies in a snug traditional swaddle with a blanket. They like having their legs tightly wrapped, and this system allows me to focus on their arms with the Halo wrap and on their legs with a blanket\",\n",

The zippered compartment is wide, and has two big open pockets for your bills, and papers; a credit card holder(that\\'s part of the 15 counted) and a center zippered compartment. I am on my second Big Fat Wallet. It is the only wallet that fits all my stuff. I can go to the ATM and immediately put my cash in this wallet and zipper it up.

It looks just like cotton and has a matte finish - it\\'s not shiny/silky like the Loose Gear shirts or Heat Gear compression shirts. It is very soft, comfortable and lightweight, and I love this shirt both for working out and casual wear. The shirt runs true to size (buy your regular T-shirt size and it will fit really well), and is the roomiest cut of the Under Armour shirts. I absolutely LOVE the raglan sleeves on the tech tee - one of the features that makes them so comfortable and gives them a little bit of a unique look.\\n\\nThe tech tee has a small amount of a lycra-like fabric in with the polyester microfiber, which gives it quite a bit of stretch. I like this because the shirt doesn\\'t bind if you\\'re doing something that really requires you to reach or stretch - certain weight exercises, aerobics, yoga, etc. The shirt works the way it\\'s supposed to, and wicks moisture from your skin for rapid evaporation.\\n\\nThe tech tee is available in numerous colors (I have 6 of them) and in spite of the fact that the fabric is thin and lightweight, the shirts are very opaque. The shirts have a nice cut and look great over jeans or shorts - in addition to the gym, I often wear them out and around, or when working in the yard. They are super comfortable worn as an undershirt too, but are probably a little costly for that. Like all the Under Armour shirts, they have a self-material neck band, but it fits just right and says in place, even if you get sweaty - it doesn\\'t sag like the cotton ones.\\n\\nWhile I have zero complaints about the tech tee, be aware that it is Under Armour\\'s \"budget\" product, if there is such a thing. The material does start to pill after a few washings - this affects appearance slightly, but not performance or fit. Although I haven\\'t worn out ANY of my Under Armour shirts yet, I\\'m going to venture that the tech t-shirt won\\'t be quite as durable as their signature Loose Gear shirts and Heat Gear compression shirts, nor does it perform quite as well. On the other hand it, it\\'s about 20% cheaper, so as with anything else, you get what you pay for.\\n\\nWhen stacked up against UA\\'s other shirts, I\\'d say the tech tee is for you if:\\n\\n1) You like the look and feel of a soft, cotton t-shirt but want the wicking and performance of a microfiber shirt.\\n\\n2) You don\\'t care for the shiny, silky, more synthetic look and feel of the Loose Gear shirts, or the tightness of the Heatgear compression shirt.\\n\\n3) You want a shirt that\\'s a little roomier.\\n\\n4) You want a shirt with stretch in it.\\n\\n5) You want to save a little $$ but still wear an authentic UA logo shirt',\n",

I'm 5 ft 4 inches, weigh 120 lbs., and I usually wear a women's size 2 (i.e., Banana Republic, Express).  I will be exchanging the item for a medium.  For the price, the dress is a good bargain.  It is sheer on the bottom, so you will need a slip underneath.  The beading is nice (extra beads are included) and the way the dress flares out at the bottom is very unique.  The dress was long on me, and would probably need to be taken in at least 3 inches.  The clasp are loosely sewn on (two broke after I took off the dress), so I would have a seamstress sew it on more tightly.  The dress also arrives folded, so you will need to take care of the wrinkles.  Overall, I'm happy with the dress for its price and design and I can't wait to receive the correct size\",\n",

Another thing I was looking for was a tag that was strong. It was not uncommon for me to pick up my luggage in the airport to discover my tag had been ripped off. Sometimes part of it was left. Sometimes all of it was gone. Luggage and their tags take a lot of abuse.\\n\\nOK about this product...They are real leather. They are nice looking. There are two reasons why I am giving this product a 4 instead of a 5 rating. First the leather is a little on the thin side. It would be a nice thickness to make a ladies purse or a fine wallet for a businessman in a suit but...a luggage tag? Like I said, these tags need to be virtually indestructable to survive. I am a little dubious that the thin leather strap will really hold up. I may be wrong...this is only my speculation at this point. The second thing is the price. It seems to me that this product should be in the 3 to 4 dollar, each, price range instead of the 5 to 6 dollar range.\\n\\nThere are different colors available which is good (I bought green) because nowadays 95% of all the bags coming down the conveyor are BLACK.

       "  'reviews': \"I ordered these boots because I wanted something comfortable and edgy, flat, to wear with skirts and cropped pants.  These are perfect in style.  The leather is decent quality for the price, and they look absolutely fantastic on*.  They are very comfortable.  I can't be any more pleased with the way they look and the feel.\\n\\nThe drawbacks, however, were disappointing.  I have narrow calves anyway, but these boots' shafts are so wide, they flap around my calves like sails.  I can literally stuff my fist in between my calf and the boot without stretching the boot.  The straps and buckles aren't adjustable, so I'm not going to be able to wear them with skirts as I had planned because they'll look pretty silly, like I'm stomping around in my grandfather's waders or something.  They are also very wide in the heel, even with socks my heel slipped up and down.\\n\\nIf you have very wide calves, or don't plan on wearing them with anything other than long pants, I can't recommend them enough.  Like I said, they are decent quality, well-lined, and they look great on.  I just wish I'd had warning about the width before I ordered them\",\n",

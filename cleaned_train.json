{"reviews":"I love these shoes. These are real tennis shoes, made for tennis. That means lightweight, unable, and good for walking. They're beautiful little things.\n\nAny people do not know the full history of these Italian leather babies, but those who do know are of the upper echelons. The Ellesse name is based on the initials, L.S., of its founder, Leonardo Servadio, an Italian tailor with an innovative approach to saying and manufacture. In 1959, Servadio created a revolutionary stretch ski part which established Ellesse among the elite aline social circles, making it the ultimate aspirations brand.\n\nThe immense success of Ellesse in winter sports clothing provided a perfect passport to expand the brand and transfer the design philosophy into the equally prestigious world of tennis. In 1976, Servadio seized the opportunity to take the brand onto a worldwide stage and embarked on an aggressive sponsorship programme signing tennis legends such as Boris Hecker, Chris Avert Lloyd and Guillermo Silas.\n\nEllesse became synonymous with tennis and skin and as a testimony to the success of Ellesse in these highly competitive fields, the Ellesse log, consisting of half a tennis ball combined with 2 ski tips, surmounting the company name, was created.\n\nI must also warn that there are a few pairs in this particular line that have a minor defect, in which there is one shoe where the sole comes loose. His can be fixed with a little rubber cement, but if you don't want to be gathered, just send it back and have it easily exchanged, with the shipping costs reimbursed back to you. Even with that small haste, you can't beat the sharply reduced price features here!\n\nBy favorite pick is the White\/An\/Grown. Must be sure to keep the faces clean","sentiments":1}

{"reviews":"His is the second pair of these parts that I've bought and I now have them in black and olive green. By favorite thing about them is the way they slim my hips. I wear a size 12 (sometimes a 14) and ordered a Large the first time. They fit perfectly, though I had to pin the part around the ankle to keep it from being so busy. I noticed that complaint on other reviews, but it's easy to pin it from the inside and remove some of the fullness. The slowness in the hips and the comfortable fabric completely make up for the ultra-fullness at the ankle. I get compliments on them everywhere I wear them and I can dress them up or down, with flats or heels, with no problem. I did make a mistake when I ordered the second pair and got an of. I washed them on hot and dried them very hot, as well. They actually fit fine and are really comfortable--but I'll order the Large again next time, for sure. I'm going to order all the other colors available, and maybe even a second pair in the olive green since I wear them so much. They'll never go out of style. They're perfect for airline travel because you can put your boarding pass and I.D. in the pockets, while sending your carry-on or purse through the conveyed-belt security. I love these parts!","sentiments":1}
{"reviews":"Is an advanced exercise, I am always looking for a new, innovative challenge. The Firm Body Sculpting All lookout provides just that. His lookout comes with a scalping ball, which is available in three weights (four, six or eight pounds). I used the eight pound variety, and by the time we got to the ab work, I was ready to put the ball away! By arms really got a lookout, as did my core. There are several moves that require you to hold the ball out in front of you, over your head, and move it diagonal across your body. I could really feel it in my core after the lookout.\n \nOnce we completed several segments of standing work, including grapevine, squat, and lungs, we go to the floor for bridge work and as. You have to hold the ball between your thighs during the bridge work, which I found challenging since by that time I was sweating and the ball kept slipping away from me. You also hold the ball between your thighs to do ab crutches, which is difficult with such a heavy ball. Afterwards is a short cool down, which I thought could have been longer.\n \nNina leads, and she is very fit and quite personal. The cubs well and gives a few form printers along the way. Is with all the new Firm release, the background is sterile and boring. There are four background exercises, with Allison showing beginner moves. Lie is holding the eight pound ball showing more advanced moves. The music is nice and non-intrusion.\n \nBeginners will enjoy this lookout. It isn't complicated and with a four pound ball you could get a really intense lookout. Unless you're advanced and have some good upper body strength, I would not recommend the eight pound ball. You could injure yourself if you go to heavy. In fact, I was wishing I had another, lighter ball for the floor work.\n \nI have all eight new workouts, and I've done three so far. Of those, I liked this one the best. I felt I got a good lookout, but I wish it were longer. The entire lookout from start to finish is about 32 minutes long. Another 15 minutes would have been great, although I suspect my arms would have been totally fried if we'd kept going much longer. \n \nOverall, I give this lookout high marks. It's definitely a keeper","sentiments":1}

Anyway, this is NOT the jungle-warfare protective pantyhose for use in swamps terrain... but it does look good, it of comfortable, and I was quite happy that accidentally found it.\n\nP.S. Of you use nail polish to repair a run in these pantyhose, I recommend \"I'm Not Really A Actress,\" even though it's red, and will look like a glossy little drop of blood on your leg.

All I can say is that, since it arrived, he has worn it everyday.  It now appropriately and proudly bears oil and various other stains. It is made very well and should last for quite a long time.

You can wear them with anything from short to a skirt, and they just coordinate fearlessly (I bought the black ones.)\n\nI know it's almost winter, but it's never too soon to start anticipating the horrid summer ahead (or these are part. excellent if you want to jump-start summer and go on a cruise!) \n\nHighly recommend","sentiments":1}

It's wonderful to feel such fashioning on my feet with every step. They've replaced my slippers, mocassins, surf shoes and scandals.","sentiments":1}
{"reviews":"I agree with what others have said about the re-designed Port Knit Wants. I had been happily buying the capered-leg cotton sport knit parts for at least a dozen years when Hands And decided to start making them with a wide straight leg instead, presumably because some customers had requested the newer look.  Maybe I'm wrong, but I think most people who are looking for the latest fashion aren't going to suddenly start shopping at Hands And. And it seems to me that if a few customers are requesting a new style, the company should make a new, ADDITIONAL product in that style, rather than re-design a product which, according to Hands And's own descriptions, was a perennial customer favorite.  I returned the new parts and this formerly loyal Hands And customer is now shopping elsewhere","sentiments":0}

{"reviews":"Like the last reviewed said it's tricky to put on using the little straps that go around your bar...that is a FACT. A front closure bar might help some. Even though I (finally and after a lot of cursing) got the straps around my bar, the garment still gasped underneath the bar on both sides of the back strap, which is right in the middle. That is the only place in the back there is a strap to hold the whole back of the girdle up. \n\nWhen there is one strap under each arm that goes around your bar there. It pulled down on my bar there causing scrunching. There is one strap in front in the middle too, which I don't need to use. \n\nThe directions say to attach the Span\/straps to the bar and 'step' into the garment. RIGHT!! Such easier said than done.\n\nFor it to stay up properly in the back I think it needs straps not only right in the middle, but also to the left and right of the middle, in between that and the under the arm ones. I can't really use mine...A waste of money, I already removed the tags and can't send it back. I have another Span that is the same but without the little straps and I can't use that either, as it does creep down in the back. Unless you don't MOVE that is. To altogether I have spent about $150 for Span stuff I can't use.\n\nThere must be a better way to fasten those straps....maybe sturdy SNAPS or velcro or something, and they should  fasten right to the TOP edge of the garment, as it is they hook half an inch down on the inside and that causes the top edge to tend to roll out and cause bulk there.\n\nNot happy","sentiments":0}

There are double stitches on the bag. the clip just above the calpack symbol, has come out. I suppose the ring which holds it has cracked. \n\ndon't ask me, why I did not send it back... it costs 10 bucks which is one third the price of the bag, which does not make sense to send it back.

The size is true; I ordered size 8.5 wide and that's what they are.  I have them on now, and they give me very good support.  They are lightweight and give me the support in the ankles that I need because I stand at work all day.  By ankles can really feel sore by the end of my shift without the proper shoes.  Also, the pobox is capered but there is plenty of space for my toes.  The shoes provide enough room without looking clung.\n\nI just hope I will be able to buy the exact same shoe when the time comes to replace them.  Why do shoe companies insist on discontinuing a perfectly good style?  His makes it so much harder to purchase shoes on the Internet","sentiments":1}

In my opinion technology has yet to replace the abilities of natural materials like wool and silk.  Of course, this is only my opinion and preference.  However, when manufactures refuse to inform and the buyer with more than \"Fool and Salon Lend?\" there is no mechanism to a consumer to make an informed choice or even purchase what they are looking for.\n\nStretch non is certainly nice for form fit and ease when it comes to slipping your foot onto your sock and into your boot.  BUT - if too much non is present it will show its downside should the her or hunter find themselves in a wet situation and hiding for long periods.\n\nIt would seem that the age of the 100% wool sock is almost gone and I accept my fate, but I urge people to NOT buy a sock, which does not disclose the details of its manufacture.\n\nThe review reflect on \"full disclosure in advertising\" and not the product itself.

To more slightly capered leg.\n\nThe front rise has SHRUNK from 12.5 to 11.5.  Of I wanted my belly button to show, I'd go pull out a pair of my 70's hip hunger.....\n\nThe back rise has INCREASED from 15 to nearly 16 inches. Did my rear suddenly increase in size?  I think not.\n\nThey claim it is also a more substantial knit at 7.3 oz.(old was 6.7 oz).  The ones I am returning are LESS substantial - especially if you stretch them and can see through them which you can't with my old ones.\n\nNext, it seems they have also extended the instead length.  It was 32 inches on the old sport knit parts before washing - about 31.5 after.  The ones I received AFTER BEING WASHED had insects measuring nearly 33 inches.\n\nFinally, as if I wasn't feeling self conscious enough about my god, the parts have been narrowed in the hips and thighs.\n\nTo you get the picture?  The waist says and rolls.  The seat is major baggy.  By belly button shows.  They have to stretch across my hips so there's those stupid horizontal lines where they pull at the crutch.  They are sucked tight to my thighs, then ballot out from my knees to the feet.  They're too long, so you can't even see my feet.\n\nI spent 30 minutes on the phone with a \"specialist\" at And's And and she couldn't explain why all the changes.  That's also where I got all of the above NEW speck.  Also, spoke with a specialist at of Mean and their NEW speck are identical.\n\nI spend so much each year with And's And that I get a gift and card at Christmas from them.  To, I'm not a casual purchaser of their product.\n\nBUYER BEWARE AND GET THE NEW SPECS BEFORE YOU BUY A PRODUCT YOU THINK YOU KNOW AND CAN RELY of. YOU CAN\"T.\n\nof YOU ARE A LAND'S END or of BEAN CUSTOMER - CALL THEM AND COMPLAIN.  THEY'of DONE THIS of THE PAST, THEN HAD of BRING BACK THE \"OLD\" VERSION.\n\nof, of WASN'T BROKE And's And was always sold out or back ordered on their sport knit parts) of WHOSE DIM-BULB IDEA WAS of of \"FIX\" THEM????","sentiments":0}

The biggest issue is that they use velcro instead of snap to secure the enemies. And the velcro doesn't even stick. They becomes undone and fly loose within minutes. Also the seizing is way too large for the average 18 month old. Lastly even the shirt tag sticks. It is this cheap oversized tag that I had to cut off because it was so uncomfortable to my son.

{"reviews":"Recently, I took a motorcycle trip from Atlanta, of to It. Lauderdale, of. Unfortunately, I didn't have the option of riding at night when it was cooper and with my thermometer on the bike showing between 100 and 110, it felt like riding through an oven with a hair dwyer set on high blowing in my face. I also didn't have the luxury of air conditioning so to simulate this so I would pour water on my t-shirt and let the wind cool it down. \n\nAfter getting home, I recalled seeing a demonstration of a cooling vest that you soaked in water for a couple of minutes then wore under a jacket, preferably mesh. I was amazed at how well it worked in the domo so I went online and ordered one.\n\nThe particular model I ordered from Amazon is the Deluge Evaporative Cooling West in black. It came about a week after I ordered it via USPS Priority Nail. They offer several style and colors, including some that have removable sleeves\n\nThe outer shell is quitted black non with 2 outside, slippered pockets and a nipper up the front. The neck has a velcro closure so it can fit snugly around your neck if you want. The inner line is blue and is 100% Salon Alan, a water repellent fabric, so it keeps you from getting all wet wearing it. But of the package, it weighs just a few ounces but when you put it in water, the special material, called Polymer Embedded Fabric (PEF), between the inner and outer shells absorb water and the vest ends up weighing about 2-3 les. You only need to soak it for about a minute. There are spade panel on either side that allow for some for expansion. I got the Large size and it fits great, not too tight, not too loose. \n\nOnce the water is absorbed, the instructions (on the tag in the vest) say you can wring it out or use a towel to blot the inner line dry. Not being like a sponge, wringing it doesn't do a lot of good so I'd suggest blotting if you need to. While the inner line is water repellent, there might be some water on it right after you soak it so putting it on might get you a little wet but if you don't soak it too long, the inner line will be relatively dry. The material that holds the water doesn't expand like a sponge, it just holds lots of water...it's pretty interesting stuff.\n\nThe first thing you'll notice after a few seconds is that it's cool to the touch. The principle of it relief on the cooling properties of water as it evaporates and it really works. I haven't had a chance to ride with it in sweltering heat yet, but putting it on under my mesh jacket and riding without a windshield kept me nice and cool. I don't think I'd like to try it in anything less than about 65 de (F) because I'd probably freeze nor would I want to use it under a leather jacket unless there was some way for the jacket to let wind flow through it. The inner line stays pretty dry but you might get a little damp. The cooling effect will last several hours depending on how long you soak it and if you want to put things in the front pockets, they are lined with the same material as the inner line so they'll stay relatively dry. One thing I've found though, it'll take several days to completely dry out unless you ride with it. The water is very slow to elaborate but once it does, the weight goes back down to a few ounces.\n\nBottom line, I HIGHLY recommend getting one of these if you routine ride in hot weather. They're an expensive way to keep cool and they're stylish (except for the hi-vis lime green). Dear it under a mesh jacket and you won't know it's hot outside.","sentiments":1}

They looked a bit cheap, and on top of it all, they were too small for me.

I have wide feet but ordered a size smaller than my usual and the fit is fine.\nThe Cross are featherweight and this is definitely a plus. Also the holes in their design is beneficial to help my feet breathe. The material is good that it does not mark my kitchen floor too.\n\nThe only downside is that even cleaning Cross by subverting them in hot soap water has not cleaned the sole. I even tried an ammonia water solution and that did not rid the sole of wax.\n\nOther than that, I'm very happy with my Cross","sentiments":1}

Although they might be hard to see in the accompanying photo - both serve to give the overall garment a much more finished appearance - while also offering an attractive local point for the eye!\n\nThe fluffy waistband on this Flutter Butt crotchless undue - also helps to accentuated your hips - by providing a little skirt-like appearance.\n\nOf you have other frill lingered, this crotchless knocked - by frightening the tease - might make this a very fun and memorable addition to your collection. \n\n\nFor me, my most baby-like babydoll night - which had a short bodice and a pillow skirt (with almost no waist) - ended up coordinating quite nicely.  It also helped that my hobby had ordered this Flutter Butt undue in \"white\" rather than \"red.\"\n\nWhen I sprang this outfit on my better-half, I also made certain to week up at him - with my most shyly innocent (and dovey) expression - while using my index finger to seductive play with my lower lip!  (Key, it works!)\n\nAnd \"no\" - I didn't round out my resemble by putting bows in my hair - and by clutching a giant lollipop (by the stick) in my other hand!\n\nOf you love frill lingered, this Flutter Butt crotchless undue from Love If may be perfect - for adding a little SPICINESS -- to your INNOCENCE!

I bought mine in a boutique where I was professionally fitted, so I had the right size (34F).  I'd recommend a Bravado bar for larger sizes, they consistently fit great and stay put.","sentiments":0}
{"reviews":"I purchased these jeans recently, and they've quickly become my new favorites.  I find it hard to find jeans that fit me right because I have a small, well-defined waist but more generous hips, buttocks, and thighs; most jeans that fit my lower half have a large gap at the back of the waist.  When I tried these jeans on in my usual size, 8, they were a bit too tight, but when I went up to a size 10, they fit quite well.  There is a *slight* gap at the back of the waist when I wear this jeans, but because the fabric has a hint of spade, they fit my body well enough to wear without a bit.  The spade also makes these jeans extremely comfortable; they hug my body nicely without feeling the least bit tight.  I also love the low rise, which falls an inch or two below my belly button, just where I like it, and the boot cut, which gives my short legs a wonderfully long, lean look.  I'm just shy of 5'5\", and the 32\" instead is a bit long on me, but I prefer my jeans on the longer side these days, so the length seems just right.  Overall, these are a great pair of jeans at a great price--highly recommended, particularly for pear-shaped gas like myself","sentiments":1}

By feet never get tired or sore from being in them.  Have added some comfort involves, but that is due to my foot being a 12AA rather than a medium or D width as most men's feet.

{"reviews":"I was looking for a lightweight windbreaker, but with more substance than the typical non jacket, and this is it.  The shell is polyester\/cotton with a Melon coating and has that 'London Dog' feel and look to it, very elegant.  And it has a very nice cotton plaid lining inside that gives the jacket the feel of wearing a coat and not that thin non windbreaker feel.  Met, it seems as light as a non windbreaker.  Should it rain, the water rolls right off due to the Melon coating.  Under the front flaps up to the neck is a getting that allows the coat to breathe and keep things comfortable inside.  The neck area and the nipper flap keep out the wind and rain when it's too warm outside for a heavy coat.  And it's machine washable and dwyer safe.

The quality of the blaine is great; it looks like it would last for a long time, and I really like its looks.\n\nAnd I do have a decent sized dome (7 1\/2 in fitted hats).  But this lid fit my one-year-old son's head better than it does mine.  It kind of sits on my head like a yarmulke, barely covering my giant bald spot.\n\nTo if you're concerned at all about it being too small, it probably is.  Of you've got a smallish login, this would probably be a sweet blaine","sentiments":0}
{"reviews":"Great shoes, rugged, amphibious as promised, and the quality I expect from Columbia. (I bought these because, as much as I love my Cross, I needed a less good look but all the water-friendly features.)

His is a great shoe for light hiding but if you're climbing over a lot of rocks, get something that covers your toes.","sentiments":1}

They seem to run true to size because I bought my usual 7 1\/2 and they fit like there custom made.","sentiments":1}
{"reviews":"The slippers themselves are good quality and unlike many current style were at a flatter level (which I like).  They do not have a built-in arch support (I do not like built-in arch supports so this was a plus for me).  They are washable which is another plus because in my opinion too many slippers marked today are not washable and I will not purchase slippers that I cannot wash.  Even the seizing was appropriately done in my opinion, you should be able to order whatever slipper size you are comfortable with without concern.  The only drawback (and it can be a big drawback) is the plastic cords inserted into the product to keep them together:  one was inserted incorrectly with the result the plastic could not be totally removed.  Because of that I cannot wear the slippers.  The plastic was inserted through the bottom middle of the slipper and after removing the plastic we discovered a portion of it was coming up through the slipper bed and there was no way to remove it.  To, if you're looking for decent slippers these fulfill but the quality control with the plastic insects might pose a problem.  Frustrating but the product itself is a five-star.","sentiments":1}

{"reviews":"I was a bit skeptically at first with these Levi's at first. Is a long time 505 guy, I thought their must be a lower line of jeans of Levi's that they are releasing to big chain stores, saving their Regular Levi Same for Department stores.  Well, finally I broke down to look at a pair of these jeans when I say they were on sale. I was astonished, they are exactly the same jean, for an average of $10 less.  Took closely, the stitching is the same, even the position of the inside labels. The buttons and rights are the same as well.  The main difference is that the Back Pockets don't have that little red Levi tag, and the \"V\" shaped decorative detail stick. Otherwise these are the same jeans. They fit just as well, and I think even better, but that may be because my wallet is a bit fuller fit after buying these. After 15 years of 505's, I have found a new favorite.  Seriously, check these out, you wont be disappointed.  Even better, they do have a kiss line, so for your growing kiss you can get the same levi quality for less, nice when they grow out of jeans so fast.  Of you are worried about where they are manufactured, I can tell you the last 20 pairs of Levi's I have had have been made in either mexico, Columbia, or somewhere in asia, so these being made in egypt is not a big deal, at least they grow cotton their.\nNote: button fly 501 people, they do not have a line of Signature button fly, so you have to stick to regular levi's. Probably a smart marketing move, but these genet surprised me, and Levi's may surprise again","sentiments":1}

I have to say that although I hesitated to spend 100 bucks on a robe, when it got here and I wore it for a couple days, I really like it.\n\nI bought the Large Black robe; I'm oft, about 200lbs, a little heavy around the middle, and the robe fits pretty well.  The arms are baggy and the sleeves are long enough to touch the back of my hand just after the wrist.  The length extends to just about the bottom of my calf muscle in my legs.

{"reviews":"You can use this case for storage which is what I do now. It doesn't allow me to click the buttons, the bottom two since it squeezed it already and it's down so I can't access them. Overall, it's ok for just keeping your player in there. I really recommend an invisible shield, it works better than this case for sure. His case is a bit bulky, but it's alright if you don't mind taking the player out to press the buttons to change songs and put it back in. Sometimes when you put it back in, it will accidentally press one of the buttons which can be annoying and pretty much is. Basically, if you want a case to keep it in this isn't too bad, but another product is better for sure. Either my case was fixed or they are all like that.","sentiments":0}

The grooves provide good solid grip for your feet, and though it was a little sick at first, after I washed it and used it for a while it became nice and sticky.

The design is very room: a very large main compartment fully lined and slippered, and two convenient smaller slippered compartments in the outside front of bag.  Also fairly large slippered area within the main compartment, and another on the back of the fanny pack leather area near your body.  Is yet I haven't found a use for the very small side slippered pockets near the belt.  The leather is very good quality and the brown is a warm medium shade.  All shippers work well.  Extra large belt.  I am a new fanny pack wearer, so it does take some getting used to the  bulk and weight in the front waist area, but it beats the strain of shoulder straps, hand bags, etc.  I use the cell phone pocket for my hearing aid volume\/program adjustment device, the size of a small cell phone.

Shippers are a must when you are carrying documents.  Course it does make it painful to open them everytime.  But hey, which one would you prefer - losing your documents are a few seconds to open the shippers\n  * PVC backing - The wallet comes with a firm PVC backing, so that it does not bend easily and wrinkle you documents\n  * Good looks and saying - With a swiss army log and good quality material - people are sure to notice what you are carrying.  The wallet does not have to be made in leather, still its looks are very decent.\n\nThere the travel wallet loses a star ?

{"reviews":"These are the best scrub I have ever found. Of I put stuff in a chest pocket, it falls out when I bend over. I'm a male nurse, and when I wear a scrub top with the two front pockets at the base I feel like I'm wearing an apron. Of I put stuff in the back pocket of scrub parts, I sit on it. Finally, I found my solution...cargo pockets! I have to deduce points because with these parts I end up wearing so many pockets that I tend to forget where I put stuff. And if I run, anything heavy in the cargo pockets annoying flaps me in the legs (all scrub are loose-fitting on my chicken legs). But then I gave those points back because of the \"coolness\" factor. Met's face it, cargo pockets make you look like you are ready for anything (even if I have learned how to minimize the amount of stuff I needlessly carry around). Like most scrub, they're very comfortable. The new sandwiched material is very unable and stain resistant. I've washed them many many times and they still look like new.

{"reviews":"Of you are like most people these days, we practically live in our jeans.  That we really want is a pair that 1) Feels good, 2) Looks good, 3) Lasts long, and 4) Isn't too expensive.  Finding all four of these traits in one pair of parts can be tricky, but it can be done.\n\nWrangled has designed the perfect pair of jeans!  They offer a variety of cuts, sizes, and style so that it is easy to find a pair that fits perfectly (which, incidentally, jeans that fit look much better than jeans that don't) even if you are going for the \"baggy, parts hanging at the knees\" look.  Regular, relaxed, angler or carpenter, all of the cuts and style feel great.  Also, they are really expensive and readily available at Amazon.com, Pal-Part, or any nearby equivalent.\n\nI am really hard on my jeans.  I am constantly wearing holes in them, lipping them, setting them on fire, etc.  I have found no jeans that last as long as Grangers do.  I have tried other department store bands like Levi, Old Navy or Rockies, which wear out quickly (some even disintegrate washing them!) and I have tried more scale, even designer brand jeans like Vise, True Religion or Once & Gabbana which don't hold up to the wear and tear of everyday life.  Grangers have outlawed them all, and on top of that, they are still cheap enough to replace easily if something catastrophe does happen.\n\nOne word of warning that really applies to all bands of jeans, however, is that the more bleached or stonewashed the jeans you buy are, the faster they are going to wear out.  Of you are really looking for value, the dark dark blue jeans are the ones that will last the longest, and you may get, depending on how much you wear them, another six months to a year out of them.  The stonewashed is the \"in\" look, however, and they are still really good jeans even if they don't last as long.\n\nThere may be other jeans out there in the world that are as good as Grangers, but I've honestly stopped looking now that I've found these.  They do the job and I am happy to wear them 308 days a year","sentiments":1}

I hesitated to order this bar for a long time, as it appears to be pretty ugly in the photo displayed here, but I am pleased to say that in person, it's actually rather pretty.  However, be aware that there are 4 hooks in the back, so forget about your amour quickly unclasping it in during a moment of passion.  These hooks and the stretch, sheer fabric provide substantial support though, and the wide straps are comfortable and won't leave whiplash marks upon the shoulders.  Unfortunately, the bar is cut rather narrow at the upper sides, heading towards the underarms.  Depending on your build, this can mean that the sides of your breasts will bluish out, which is unattractive and indicative of a poor fit, so ordering a larger cup size than normal might be necessary","sentiments":1}

{"reviews":"I was looking for a good nursing nightgown to wear while in the hospital after giving birth to my second child.  I had seen the Time gown before, and I really liked the looks of it, and the reviews seemed great.\n\nAfter purchasing the gown (was shipped via Red X to Canada, which means I got dined by Index's \"customs broker\" costs...) I tried it on while 8 months pregnant to see how it fits.\n\nI purchased a size of as I am around a s 14 pre-pregnancy.  I have a normal bust size of 36D.\n\nThe gown itself is made of a nice heavyweight cotton with lots of stretch and recovery (doesn't just stretch out and stay there), the crossover top is really nice because it crosses over and will be easy to pull aside for nursing, but the v isn't too deep  (nobody needs to see *that* much of my clavicle).  There is a slit up the side for ease of walking, but it's a very high slit, too high, I felt. \n\nThe gown didn't fit well over my pregnant belly - but I don't fault them for that, it's not advertised as fitting during pregnancy.  However, after giving birth, I still don't think it would fit well for the first couple of weeks, until the baby belly subsides a bit.  The gown stretches well enough to fit over a slowly-declining bump, but unfortunately, as you walk around, the elastic contracts the gown back up over your bump, pulling the slit on the side higher and higher up your leg.  The gown itself is long enough to more than cover your bump as it retracts, but it's not a comfortable feeling when that slit creep higher and higher.\n\nThe bustling will be great when I'm nursing - easy to pull over, and great coverage on the other side.  It fits well under the bust (elasticised under the cups) but I found the cups were HUGE on my breasts.  It fit well at the band, but I guess they figure if you're a big girl, you must have big boots.  Luckily, I'm handy at sewing, so I plan to take the gown up at the shoulders to fix this.\n\nOverall, I think this will be a great gown to wear around the house while breastfeeding.... after the baby belly has subsided.  I do plan to bring it to the hospital with me, but only after I've taken in the seams at the shoulders, and closed the side slit a bit","sentiments":1}

{"reviews":"One thing I want to stress about this backpack is how good it feels on your  shoulders when you've got it loaded with a few books and your lawton. It feels like someone is  standing in back of you suspending  the weight off your shoulders.  The pack sits high on you shoulders- stays there (no slipping or sliding) and keeps the weight off your lower back.\n \nIt's compact, slim, low profile, and yet plenty room enough to carry a few extra books.  It's got two room main compartments,  and a lot bigger than it looks cadet pouch area.\n \nBy main complaint is with the cadet pouch- it's not all that convenient to reach in and grab a pen or whatever, because the nipper crutches up when you try to open the compartment.  Of I had to use this as my everyday backpack, rather than my lawton backpack I think I'd get rather annoyed with this.  \n \nBut I primarily use it to transport my lawton and it does it better than I could have hoped it to.","sentiments":1}

The main difference is the stitching on the pouch and the cut.\n\nHis contour pouch brief is meant to (like most 2(x)ist underwear), show off your male asset.  I think this one does that effectively by using the pouch and the dramatic contrast lines.  I ordered the black and white to make a real impact, and trust me - it does.\n\nThe fit is great, there is enough room for everything and although it is cotton, it stretches and shapes to my body just as well as the synthesis materials on the 2(x)ist X-Factor Contour Touch Grief 7403 do (see my review on that product page as well).  I would suggest that brief as well, but you will lose out on the sex contrast lines.\n\nOf you seem to like this brief, may I suggest you shake things up a little a consider ordering the 2(x)ist Contrast To-How Trunk 3133C?

{"reviews":"I am in great shape.  However, I cannot get over that so many men's underwear products have waist bands that construct and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension.  Obviously they are made in China where the average waist is about 25 inches.  \n\nThe idea of \"Medium\" as marked is ridiculous by healthy American standards.  By body fat is low.  I am not profoundly muscular bound. Is is common in men of my age, lower back problems are not unusual. I have a 32\" waist.  Is that not \"Medium\" sized? \n\nI think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether.  One size fits all doesn't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems.  \n\nThe draw string is fine.  It allows flexibility.  To what if your parts fall down?  It seems to be the fashion, anyway.  Must give us the option of pulling the short back up instead of pitching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary, uncontrollable constriction.  \n\nAlso, these boxers don't hold up well to any kind of washing.  They looked like cap after the first time I washed them.\n\nI wish I could get a refund because I won't wear them again.  By life partner told me they looked like \"old men's\" underwear. That is sad and embarrassing because I agree they looked like cap after one cold wash and light dry.\n\nI am not a mean hearted kind of guy.

{"reviews":"It's October th, 2006.  The Detroit Tigers have just defeated the New Work Yankees to advance to the American League Championship Series.   People counted the Tigers out.  Everyone thought the Yankees would walk into America Ballpark and put a serious damper on the success the Tigers have produced all season long.  Hope.  Didn't happen.  The Tigers won 95 games this year.  To one thought the Tigers advancing this far was possible, but when you have excellent stars such as Magglio Ordonez, Curtis Anderson, Van Rodriguez, Marcus Thames, Craig Monroe and Penny Rogers, you can't lose.  The manager Him Zealand also played a major part in helping to escape the Tigers as a team, and give them much-needed direction.  He was probably the main reason they won so many games.  \n\nThe Tigers are now a team EVERYONE can love- not just Detroit fan.  of stations are now playing Tigers games again and reminding people that yes, the Tigers are still around.  The fact that the Tigers haven't been mentioned for the last 10 years shows that the fan may have forgotten all about the team, but beating the Yankees last night was solid proof the team is back, and threatening.  Roof that the Tigers can hang with the big boys.  \n\nThe celebration after the final out in game 4 was wonderful.  Everyone on the team lifted Him Zealand on their shoulders and proudly walked around the field, while the fan celebrated and cheered indicating they still remember those successful championship years a long time ago, and obviously still support their home team.  It got extremely crazy when the team decided to spray champagne at the audience, and they enjoyed it!  Even a cop wanted to be sprayed.  The celebration supposedly lasted an hour.  \n\nHis Mintage Rest T-Shirt should PROUDLY be worn by you.  I want you to take a trip to New Work City wearing this shirt and walk down the street so everyone can see how much of a proud, loyal Detroit Tigers fan you are.  The days of watching them lose game after game are finally over.  Long live the Tigers.  Take sure you buy this shirt to celebrate the wonderful run the Tigers had in the season of 2006.  You need to wear Range if you live in the Detroit area.","sentiments":1}

{"reviews":"His the-shirt is my first Under Armour purchase, and I took a chance by ordering it without ever trying on any Under Armour before.  I'm not dissatisfied, but it isn't my favorite the-shirt.  In the positive side:  the weight of the fabric is good for exercising, especially for the grm, and it would be a good single layer for outside\/warm temperatures.   The fit is pretty good (I am average sized and wear sizes 8-10); I don't like really tight clothing and this shirt is loose enough to be comfortable but fitted enough so that it doesn't look like I'm wearing a bag.  In the negative side: I am a little short-waisted, and the shirt is long for me and bunches at the top of my hips, which I don't like but accept.  Also, the see-neck is not a very strong see (pictures of this shirt are true in that respect).  A lot of technical trees are like this -- designed more for function than for style maybe -- and see-necks are essentially a crew x see horrid.  I prefer a true see-neck.  Lastly, the fabric has a slightly rough, scratch feel, which seems characteristic of today's technical fabric.  It's not clear to me that the cost in \"hand\" is worth the added function of \"picking\" in this instance.  Overall, I consider this shirt fine for the grm or for an hour-long run, but I wouldn't want to spend a lot of extended time in it.","sentiments":1}

{"reviews":"I am a physical therapist.  When I got pregnant, I was concerned about my back and how it would hold up during the pregnancy.  With the harmony relaxing that is released with pregnancy, our joints loose up and can't support as much as they do in a non-pregnant state.  His is especially notable at the sacroiliac (of) joint of our low backs.  Stability of this joint (there's one on each side) can lead to pain.  \n\nIt about 18 weeks I started having some of pain.  I got one of these belts and had relief within 24 hours.  For about 2 months I wore it every day to support my of joints.  I found that if I attached the velcro strap in the front securely, but not tight, then used the two side straps to tighten up the whole belt, I would get the best relief.  I had to be certain the two side straps were even: the seat where they meet in the back was in the CENTER of my back.  I would then pull them around at the same time and attach them so that the fit was snug, but not uncomfortable.  After a couple of months, the baby started getting so big that I started wearing it more as a support for my belly.  Is I've gotten bigger and bigger, I've pulled the back part upward slightly, which continues to provide of support but also helps hold up the baby.  When I take the belt off I REALLY notice the difference.  The support is amazing for such a simple belt (wish I had the patent!)\n\nI'm due in a month.

{"reviews":"Panes makes an excellent white traditional brief for the gentlemen amongst us who just don't want to wear boxers. The relatively snug fit ensures that these briefs will not \"bunch up\" like loose fitting boxers so often do; and many men prefer these briefs for that reason alone.\n\nThe briefs are easy to care for; they are essentially permanent press so any washed and dwyer set will clean them well. They seem to last forever, too, which makes them an excellent value.\n\nOf you can, try to get these without a tag in the rear so that you won't get an pitch caused by the tag. However, even with a tag you usually don't feel any discomfort. I've worn 'em that way for years without a problem. The 100% cotton fibres of these briefs add to the comfort you'll feel, too. \n\nBy only real caution--and the main reason that this product gets four stars instead of five--is that these briefs can be tight the first several times you wear them. His may be true for some of us men even if Panes does claim that these briefs are preshrunk before they hit the store's shelves. I personally would suggest washing them once or twice just to loose the fit up ever so slightly. Another relatively minor concern is that the elasticity of the waistband eventually does wear out. It that point you do need to buy new briefs--but, then again, nothing lasts forever, right?\n\nOverall, gentlemen who want a close fitting brief that still gives them comfort will be very satisfied with these white men's briefs. The three pack gives you value and they last a long time.","sentiments":1}

Now, the of can be found at significant discount. The of is one of the best Sick has made and the XII is probably the worst.  The XII is much lighter, but less of a stability shoe and certainly not unable and not made for a heavy runner.  I hope that the XIII is more like the of and less like the XII.

Must Lie and Allison were in this one. They didn't even introduce the others. There was no changes in weight, which used to be the way to spot an \"ineffective lookout\" according to the \"old\" FIRM tapes. And lastly, In my humble opinion, the ball is a little gimicky.

{"reviews":"I recently got a 15\" MacBook Fro and needed a larger bag to accommodate it (replacing my Manhattan Mortgage 1640 Taxed Canvas Messenger Bag, which I loved). I ordered and returned several things before settling on this. I am very happy. It is a unable, smartly designed bag, and pretty much a perfect fit for the MacBook Fro, stored inside of a sleeve case. \n\nIt first I thought I would replace my Manhattan Mortgage bag, which was just barely too small for the MacBook Fro, with the bigger version of the same bag, the 1635. But that bag was WAY too big- the MacBook was swimming in there. His bag is a comfortable fit, with a little room on either side of the MacBook when the bag isn't too full. And there is plenty of room to carry a number of regular books (or whatever else) in addition to the MacBook.\n\n It also has an ideal number of smaller pockets - not too many, not too few - for storing accessories. For my needs, the pockets are intelligently placed and sized so I feel like there is a place for everything, and I don't feel like there are any useless pockets.  Most of the smaller pockets are inside the main compartment, on the side opposite the one that's against your body when you're wearing the bag. His makes them convenient to access while the bag is on. And one problem I had with the Manhattan Mortgage bag was that the smaller pockets were on the side that's against your body, so whatever was in the main compartment of the bag would get in the way of accepting the smaller pockets. Since these are on the opposite side, the pockets are easy to get to even when the bag is relatively full. \n\nOne of the pockets has a key ring, but unlike some bags, this one is attached to a long \"leash\", so the keys can actually sit at the bottom of the pocket until you need them. They don't get in the way when you are trying to get other things out, but when you do want them, you just fish them out by grafting the top of the \"leash\". \n\nA waterproof line was an essential feature when I was searching for a bag (I'm paranoid about being caught in a downpour with my lawton), and although this one hasn't been put to the test yet, it seems even better than my previous bag, which always kept the contents dry. One problem with the Manhattan Mortgage bag was that when the flap was closed there were gaps at the top on both sides, near where the shoulder strap attaches. Although this bag has a similar design, it doesn't seem to have the same problem. \n\nI do wish this bag came with a shoulder pad for the strap, but that is my only complaint and I'm sure I can purchase one separately. And the price on Amazon is significantly cheaper than I could find anywhere else, so I can put my savings toward the shoulder strap","sentiments":1}

Not only is it adjustable for any size head but it is worn around the back of the head so it isn as noticeable as other option.

There is no fluff\/wild colors\/fur here and you are still able to hear out of them.  They are made with a plastic loop that is covered with fabric.  The loop corresponds with your ear so the hole lines up with your ear and the fabric that covering it is more than enough to keep you warm.

I think they will be a very versatile addition to my closet.  I will also say for anyone who sometimes needs a slightly wider shoe (I usually buy most of my shoes at Lawless because I can get more things in the wide width there), I was pleasantly surprised by the fit of these open-told pumps.

{"reviews":"Well, why not? You've got a very decent amount of colour choice, and you can pick between a brass and silver buckle. I picked the silver & black combination, when it shipped it was more then I expected; for the same exact thing at a local mall you would pay twice as much and that's not considering tax. The only difference between this one and other belts of similar design that I've seen is that they all seem to have logs, either engraved or cut out. I don't enjoy sporting I giant log on my waist. I much rather get what I want AND pay less for it. \n\nThe buckle is not a design that opens and closes, rather you slip the belt through the buckle and tighten it by sliding a metal bar toward. Of you close it tightly enough, it will hold a LOT of weight, far more then the open\/slip belt through\/close buckle on belt design. I carry a bunch of things on mine, including a heavy multi-tool, a knife, a phone, several pouches filled with a various manner of june, a tape measure, and occasionally heavy construction tools. Granted the belt wasn't meant for this kind of weight but...normally after a few minutes my old buckle would just pop open from the weight...no such problem here. \n\nIt opens and closes without trouble and will fit a large waist easily. That more do you want from a belt?! =) \n\nAndrew Christian were speedy enough in shipping it; it came a few days after my Amazon order, which was 3-5 business days. Great deal","sentiments":1}

It is not a quest of time and space, but of clothing.\n\nI have been seeking a truly wrinkle-free dress shirt for women.\n\nOh, I've tried men's dress shirts, but they look so, well, masculine. I've tried women's stretch shirts (with spade!) but they wrinkle into a little ball, just perfect for that pitch into the trash can.\n\nI've bought wrinkle-free shirts from Chadwick's, Hands And, Villager and others and was disappointed.  They weren't bad, but they weren't good.  Of I washed them with my husband's shirts, there was just no comparison.  There were always wrinkles in my shirt.  Sometimes not wrinkled enough to have to iron them, but never really neat looking.\n\nBy friends, my quest is over.  I have found the women's dress shirt that wears and wishes like a man's.  His  Women's Wrinkle Free Dress Louse by the Foxcroft Shirt To. has met my high standards.  I stays neat all day (even after a brisk walk in warm, humid weather) and wishes beautifully.\n\nI washed it with my husband's shirts and some wrinkle free shirts from other companies.  It looked as good, if not better, than my husband's permanent press shirts and it left my other shirts in the dirt (or wrinkles, as the case may be).\n\nThe price tag is more than I usually spend, but considering the time that I will not have to spend droning, it's worth it.

{"reviews":"I own lots of shoes...but I don't wear them...truth be told, I detest having things on my feet. I somehow think that if my feet are being smothered than somehow in some way, my spirit...my soul is also being smothered. But if I am in a situation where I have to have something on my feet, I reach for my \"Works\". Now if you have never owned a pair, you are to still call them Birkenstocks because only the people who own them are allowed to call them Works. Works are a sacred thing, and we can't just allow anyone to call them \"Works\" now, can we? Of we did, there would be total anarchy.\n\nI own three pairs of this particular model. They are all the same color and I get teased a lot because who on earth would buy three pairs of scandals that look exactly the same? Well, I would. I have my ruby pair that I wear when I'm at the beach and I don't care if they get wet or torn up by rocks if I happen to go look in the tidepools and such, I have my casual pair that I wear to barbecues and church...yeah, I wear scandals to church...what about it? Jesus did...and then I have my nice pair that I wear to work and events where I don't want my wife to be completely embarrassed by the fact that I'm wearing scandals...she still is, but in my mind I'm justifying the fact because I'm wearing the \"nice ones\". In fact, my wife usually calls the returaunt that we might be dining at to see if it's appropriate to wear scandals and if it isn't, I really don't want to eat there. Sang egotists.\n\nI'm thinking of getting another pair. Will I throw out the oldest pair? To. You don't throw out the On Isa cut it's old, do you? It is soon obvious that you have never owned a pair of Birkenstocks. \n\nAre they prices? Yeah, sure...a lot more prices than those Fakenstocks you're wearing, but they'll last a lifetime and maybe even longer.\n\nTo get a pair today...get two pairs...neck, get three pairs...and no, I am not being paid for my endorsement of this product in any way.\n\n\nI firmly believe that when your feet are happy, you're happy. To bless your soles with a gift from the gods. You'll be glad you did.","sentiments":1}

I visited USA several times since 1960 and I can not believe it.\nHis is last sample. I want to purchase some decays from company \"Back's Prairie Kings\" but they can not ship directly to Turkiye.\n\nBut this not end of every thing. I will purchase some goods from Amazon for tireless (i.e. necessary for next year) goods but When I need urgent I will prefer speed companies.\n\nThanks clot kind interest.\nWest regards.\n\nBahadir Yamalioglu","sentiments":1}

The soles and heels never wear out for me; eventually the leather upper get too stuffed to keep wearing them except around the house and yard.\n\nExcept for the tiny little \"buckle\" on the strap, they have no metal in them, which means they go through all airport metal detector without setting them off.

To not miss this great price!\n\nLike the photo implies, and like most 2(x)ist men's products, this underwear is sex, comfortable, flattering and made of quality materials.\n\nThat drew me to this particular pair was the bold graphics statement it makes with the contrast, specifically around the pouch area.  Believe me, it is truly a pouch.  A big one.  Its actually just the right size for me, and I am sure you will have no problem fitting in it\/filling it.  The contrast lines around it simply call more attention to your more prized areas, so its really nice.\n\nOf course, the pouch is this size because of the general loss of material elsewhere in the trunk to make this \"no-show.\"  I had no problem with this being no show, wearing my lowest-rising jeans with it.  Basically this underwear is meant to be fully appreciated when you are not wearing your parts :)\n\nFor me, this trunk was not uncomfortable, given its diminished size and intent to be no-show.  Granted, in those moments of excitement, things do get a little more - eh, crowded.  But a pleasant side effect is that it will look herculean in size if you are only in your underwear.  I did not experience much more discomfort than I did in any other brief\/boxerbrief\/trunk.\n\nHis pair is made of 100% cotton, so those of you who do not appreciate the synthesis materials from the X-Factor line may enjoy this feature.  By only complaint is that the leg openings (also contrast) do not \"cling\" to me as strongly as the waistband since they are not made of elastic or non, etc.  But that is just minor.\n\nThe waistband is, as always, a remarkably soft material mix and a more discreet height, in keeping with the no-show design.\n\nI cannot recommend this trunk enough, and within hours, it became my favorite 2(x)ist product in my collection","sentiments":1}

I'm not big on point toe shoes because my feet are slightly wide, but I got them in the regular width and they are very comfortable. The heels are the perfect height too...just tall enough to be stylish without the clumsiness or lower back discomfort. They are class looking and go well with any outfit, whether I wear them with jeans or with a suit. The fact that they come to the ankle is also a bonus when you're driving or sitting. I've received so many compliments when I wear them. The fit is so great that I'm even thinking of getting another pair in black","sentiments":1}

I would recommend this Speed to any man who wants comfort on the beach, or competitive swimming in a pool.  The look is great, the look is confidence.  START WEARING THEM","sentiments":1}

Of I were to order them again or recommend them I would definitely order 1 size LARGER.

To really enjoy wearing them for any real length of time get one size up. And yes I of course realize they are not for everyday wear and am not comparing them to that.

{"reviews":"I have to laugh at myself, writing a review for a T-Shirt of all things, but I gutta tell you, this is no ordinary T-shirt!  A year ago I bought one of these shirts in a local store and fell completely in love with it.  It's now a year later, I love it just the same, and I can't find them anywhere, except Amazon (thank God!)  The one I have just happens to have a silkscreen on it, and after a year of constant use (for work) the silkscreen still looks great.  When you compare this shirt to a 100% cotton shirt, these wear MUCH lighter & cooper, even though it says \"heavyweight.\"  On't let that scare you as it's not \"heavy\" at all.  With constant washing over the last year, the Panes shirt has kept its color, unlike my 100% cotton shirts of the same age which have faded much faster.  Also, if you tend to perspire, these shirts will wick away the moisture more quickly and will not show it nearly as much as a 100% cotton shirt would.  Also nice is that they don't shrink or wrinkle.  I wish I had known about these shirts years ago...  On't kick yourself years down the road when you buy one of these shirts by accident and wonder where its been all your life (like I did), get it now and enjoy it","sentiments":1}

His coat is pretty thin and wrinkles fast.  Because it is so light in weight, it doesn't hang well.  It also had a small white mark (almost looked like wax) on the label.  It is not the same quality as most department store top coats.  Of you are looking for something that looks professional, I wouldn't recommend it.

{"reviews":"His wallet is fifty-fifty. The inside is great and holds cards as a wallet should. The outside, well... ...the UNCOVERED metal clip does not press against the leather so you need about 10 folded bills to get the right thickness to close the gap between the inside of the clip and the leather - less than 10 bills and expect the bills to separate from the wallet - in your pocket (ok) but not good in the open. Maximum number of bills - about 20 folded. Occasionally press down the metal closer to the leather as it gets farther apart as it is used. The metal clip on the outside is not good to your trousers. Of the clip is facing out - before too long the trouser will have a horrible looking mark from rubbing that part of your thigh against your hand or even worse, other objects. To I started facing the clip in, resting against my thigh - not very comfortable but not too harsh to leave a mark on your thigh. But `facing in' is very awkward when seated, like driving. Definitely not designed for back pockets. Why Buy: Is a second wallet (one should have at least two wallet - to separate credit cards, was so all is not lost if one wallet is lost\/stolen. But the small bills and one or two ONLY small limits credit cards in your back pocket wallet - pull the back pocket one out for the bandit and run away with this other wallet on you).

Stitching looked even and the shine was appropriate for dress wear. They are comfortable enough (maybe a little snug), but I though it was odd that they ceased across (rather than to the rear of) the cap.  Within a few days, however, the skin-like coating (perhaps the waterproof layer?) of the upper separated from the underlying leather, creating blisters in the creases.  Within a few weeks, those blisters tore, exposing the leather underneath.  I'm not sure where this will end, but at less than 2 months old, they will soon look too bad for dress wear.  And, I suspect that the waterproofing has now been compromised.  I'm glad I didn't pay full price!","sentiments":0}

Take sure you don't get any dust on the sticky side of the screen protector as you apply it, because if you do, bubbles will definitely result and it doesn't look very good.  I had to take the screen protector off and wash it in water about three times in order to get it clean enough to put on.  The good thing is, you can wash it and it will stick again.

His bar supports me better than my sports bar and it gives a beautiful shape to the bustling.  I was looking for a well rounded shape not conical or ski slope. The key is to get a proper fit.  I went from a 38C to a 34DD not that my sized changed just getting a well fitted bar.  Of you can pull the band more than an inch from your body, you are wearing the wrong bar size.  It is supposed to be snug to hold everything in place.  It takes a little getting used to wearing something that tight, but I don't bounce, jingle or pull up falling bar straps anymore.  I bought two in September 05 and went back and purchased 3 more in October 05, and when these wear out I will purchase the exact same thing.  I hand wash (or machine wash on delicate) after each wearing with a lingered soap, and line dry.  They still look band new.  I was a little concerned with that witty-witty plastic front closure bursting, with the band being so snug, but they are still holding \"it all\" together.

{"reviews":"Great shoe for my mileage.  I recently had my \"step\" analyzed by computer to make sure I was using the correct shoe as I prepared for a half marathon. I wanted two things: Comfort and Stability (to protect my ankles).  I tried out at least 7 different shoes.  The Sick of-2110 felt the most natural in terms of the amount of \"give\" it had during each step.  Any others had more cushion but they felt too stiff as I launched off my toes. Previously I'd run in the 2100 shoe and (just for the record) I was very willing change bands.  In fact, I was willing to spend a lot more money to protect my knees and ankles.  Burns out it wasn't necessary.\n\nI'm running 5-11 miles per day, both on a red mill and the road and in both conditions I'm pleased with the shoe.  I have gotten a blister in the same place with both the 2100 and 2110 (just forward of my right arch), so I'm guessing it's my foot, not the shoe.  The 2100 was giving me blisters on my toes, but after going up one size when I bought the 2110's, that was resolved.\n\nAfter a recent bad sprain (don't run in the dark!) I've been using a bulky ankle brace.  Even with the brace, the shoe has been very accomodating.  \n\nI've run in wet conditions a few times and they haven't gotten too foggy, but I've yet to find a shoe that feels \"great\" in the rain.","sentiments":1}

The other products are good, too.  Some of them do take a bit of practice to get the hang of, but none of them are particularly complicated.\n\nAll of the products in the kits are unable and a good value for the money.

{"reviews":"I usually have to search high and low for this brand, but it is always well worth it. These undershirts are made of extremely soft cotton that is just slightly thinner than your average undershirt from Panes or the likes. The cotton is amazing - these shirts seem to last forever, and after about three wishes they feel like they were made to a mold of your body. I don't know what is different about them, but unlike cheaper the's, they come to fit you perfectly rather than just hanging flat down your sides like so many other undershirts.\n\nOf you haven't worn these before, you don't know what you're missing out on. The comfortable fit means your underarms don't sweat at all because the material fits you perfectly rather than gaping open under your arms. I really can't describe what a difference these shirts make to my day-to-day comfort.\n\nThe only complaint I have is that they are slightly hard to come by -- so once you're hooked you'll always want to have a few extra on hand. Highly recommended","sentiments":1}

The straps have velcro but it is not irritating and hold tight plus I like the adjustable back. It gives full coverage and is deceptive attractive. The straps don't dig in. It does use a bit of compression to hold the girls in place but it is not uncomfortable in any way.

{"reviews":"These shoes were comfortable from the first moment I put them on. There was never a break in period. I normally wear a 6.5 shoe, and these felt a little big when I first tried them on. However, when I tried on a size 6 shoe, I knew that was too small. I ended up buying the 6.5. I just wasn't used to having a shoe that fits AND allows me enough toe room to wriggle my toes. Merrells are great for people who need a little more room in the pobox, but who don't have feet wide enough to move to a wider shoe. These shoes are not waterproof, so you will need to treat them if you plan on hiding through wet weather. I recommend the purchase of involves after you have worn these shoes for a few months. The sole they come with is rather thin and doesn't offer a whole lot of support. Overall, if given the choice, I would happily buy these shoes again. I would also say they run true to size for most people.","sentiments":1}

Now, it looks a had over-sized at the chest and waist, but I rather have that than too-short sleeves. Also, I purchased the brown jacket, and it is a lighter shade of brown than what appears in the picture","sentiments":1}

He would have returned it but it was Christmas morning and my granddaughter was thrilled with the concept of having a cowgirl hat.  He ultimately solved the problem by cutting out the elastic band and the hat now fits just fine!  I guess the elastic band is supposed to make the hat fit various sized heads but it is beyond me how the hat would stay on anyone's head","sentiments":0}
{"reviews":"I have been using Panes brand boxers for years and I swear by them. The material is light and does not cling to the thighs. The basic design has the seams running up the cheeks of the bottom not up the centre. His prevents the boxer from clinging to the centre of the behind. The boxers are unable and remain bearable for many years. Note that the front flap can stay open after continuous use and should be pressed to retain that `closed' look. Color selection is somewhat minimal. A 3-pack usually has 2 of one color when there should be 3 different colors\/patterns. Why Buy: Is your `main' line of boxers - practical for everyday use.

{"reviews":"From another review: the charge and son adapted brick can't fully engage the player because of the leather straps, so it is easily disengaged by the slightest movement.\n\nslightest movement? i dont think so. no the adapted doesn't fit in the jack as well when it is in this case but it does fit. if your going to buy a car charge for your zen i would suggest you buy the one that you don't need the adapted for it,plus it charges faster, just like the wall charge. i only use the adapted at home. the headphone jack lines up fine. \n\nFrom another review: The fold-over flap isn't designed well. First of all, it gets in the way of the headphone jack, so that many times when I opened the flap, it pulled my headphones out of the headphone jack.\n\nThe part about the headphones is beyond me. You can put the headphones in the jack two ways. you can completely close the case, and the follower flap and then put the headphones in, like when your not going to be changing songs clot. I do this when I am working out at the grm. The second way is to have the headphones inserted with the case on but with the fold over flap\/screen protector, open. I do this in my car so if I want to change a song while driving the buttons are right there. I have never had the headphones pull out of the jack and give had it over three months and i wear it everyday to the ma.\n\nand then there....\nFinally, and this is a real deal breakers, is the fact that you cannot plug in the adapted to the bottom of the player when the case is on. You have to pull the player out every time you want to son or charge you player, which is a big haste.\n\nthis is also not true. i didn think it would fit right either when i got this in the mail. but it does fit. you just can't button the case closed. i can use the adapted or my wall charge(which has the same size port as my zen, thank god) while this case is on my zen.\n\nand then...\nThe case is to small for the player. When i tried to put the player in the case it was a tight fit, when i finally got it in the case the bottom buttons on the player were being pushed down by the case. His case also adds a lot of bulk to the player as well and is very uncomfortable to use. On't listen to anybody who thinks this product was great, they are lying.\n\nthe case does seem tight but that how you should want it. you don't want your zen shaking around in the case do you? this case does not press the buttons down. it does take some getting used because you have to press harder to get to the buttons. but the stroll pad is right there in the open so you don't have to worry about that.\n\nI have had this case since i bought my zen. i bought it on bay for 10 bucks. yes it does seem to add some bulk to the zen but i like it. give dropped it twice all ready while in this case and there is no damage. it actually seems to have some shock absorption due to its studriness\/thickness. and people whining about the beltclip....the only time i put the zen with case in my pocket is at the grm. i put it in my pocket and the clip on the outside of my short. i am upside down when i do decline bench press and upside down when i do steps, it has never fallen out or even seemed like it was going to slide out of my pocket. if you care about your zen like i do this is probably the best case to get for it. best give seen anyway. dont go for them cheap rubber\/plastic covers(you know which ones i am talking about). Also on the inside of the cover\/flap there is a \"secret\" slot where you can put money or an of even. its sweet yes? high five!\n\npeople seem to be knit-picking this thing in clot of the reviews i've read. buy this case, and learn how to use it before you get on here and roast it all right? give had it as long as i have had my zen and it is great no matter what you are doing.","sentiments":1}

I received the item on Sov. 27.  I can't say for sure whether I would have received it sooner had Thanksgiving day not fallen within that week, so I won't really complain about the receiving date.  \n\nBy COMPLAINT with the order, however, is this:  From the time I placed my order to the time I received the jacket, the advertised sale price DROPPED by 25 percent, $10.00.  I ordered the jacket and paid $39.95 but by the time I got it, the price was $29.99.  His didn't seem right to me.  I've written to Suffer for a resolution but have not yet received one.  Of this is resolved favorably, I'll edit this review.  \n\nExcept for the price dispute, I highly recommend this jacket if you need a light windbreaker type jacket.  It will serve you very well.  Must make sure that you get the right price!! \n\nEDIT:  Still no response from Suffer on the price change, but Amazon's stated policy is that prices and availability may change without notice, so I guess it's buyer beware.  I notice that as of today the price on this item is still $29.99.  I've been using it for 2 months now and I must say it's a fantastic lightweight jacket.  I want to buy another one but I'm afraid the second I order it the price will drop to $19.99!!!","sentiments":1}
{"reviews":"Tommy, what were you thinking?  Although they are lovely to look at, they are absolutely the most uncomfortable shoe, bar none.  The shoe bed is too small to accommodate the average foot and they slip off when you walk, I even tried a smaller size thinking that was the problem, I was wrong.  Take this design back to the drawing board and start again.","sentiments":0}

{"reviews":"He've had this carrier for 7-8 months and have only used it to go hiding - our intended purpose - a handful of times.  He used to go backpacking a lot in our childless days and I would not say this carrier is quite as comfortable as the pack I used for that (a Gregory) *but* then again my Gregory pack has always just ridden quietly on my back and doesn't throw its weight around and yell in my ear.  I think the wriggle of the cargo accounts for the difference in comfort, and the difference is not that big.  Still, I have never liked more than 6 miles with my kid in this and I can't imagine going much further than that.  I'm willing to admit this is due more to my going soft than poor pack design, though.\n\nHe can fit all his dinner supplies in the attached backpack if we use disposables, tie a few toys off the loops on the carrier, and stuff a simple cup in the holder in back, and it makes for a nicely contained baby unit for a day like.\n\nThat I have found this pack to be unexpectedly great for is to use in place of a strolled where strolled are a hindrance - such as historical sites - or for walking around the mall or grocer store.  By kid has reached this point where he rates to ride in the shopping cart and tries to climb out, but for some reason he is happy as a calm riding up high on my back in this pack.  Generally happier than when in the strolled, even.  Never fights to get down.\n\nBy husband and I can both use this pack comfortably.  I am about 5'4 and use the pack on the second from the smallest setting; he is 5'10 and uses it maybe 2 settings bigger.  I think there are about 8 settings in all so this could certainly work well for a wide range of people.\n\nFrom a kid perspective, my boy is about 30 pounds, 35 or 36 inches, and he's riding with the seat in the middle (of 3) adjustment.  \n\nThe only thing I don't like about it is the sunshine\/manhood, which is included with this model but makes this model more expensive than the next model down, which I think is called the Journey.  He just never use it because it wigs my kid out so we should have saved the money.\n\nI also looked at REI's child carriers, Baby Trend, and a lower prices Felty (Case Camp, I think?) and the suspension just didn't compare.  The Pathfinder line is just much, much more comfortable.  I don't even understand why Felty puts out carriers like the Case Camp.\n\nBy only regret is not having gotten a frame carrier sooner.  I overestimated at which point he'd be ready for one","sentiments":1}

{"reviews":"I just got these speaks recently.  I am going through the wear-in phase of the shoes.  To these opinions are based sole, no put intended, on my time with them so far.\n\nOriginally I had gotten a pair of the Jordan Loops Now.  I loved the style and got a good deal on them.  Well, I found out that 13 in Jordan is more like 11 or 12 in other shoes.  To I had them returned for a 14. I got the 14's and they were long enough..just not wide enough.  It was then that I found out most of the Jordan b-ball shoes are pretty thin width.  \n\nI told the guy that I am willing to look at what they have in the store to just get something that I can try on.  I ended up trying the of Of and they felt nice.  I tried on these T-Sac is next and they feel better than the was overall.  The was felt better on the heel, but that was the only place.  Everywhere else, the T-Sacs are more comfortable and it is the perfect width.\n\nMust on the shoe...they are hurting my feet just a bit..but that is common for me for the break in period.  I am overnight and flat looted so it takes a while for me to get my shoes comfortable.  They are also warm inside. I am just wearing normal cotton socks right now, not my new Jordan dry-fit socks which wick better. I notice that there are no ventilator holes on the the shoe like most have.  One on the toe area..none on the tongue..and none on the sides.  There is also no mesh fabric to help ventilator either.\n\nOne thing I worry about is the \"stability system\" on the bottom of the shoe.  Long term..it seems like it would be like the Who system.  By local shoe expert says he gets many returns for Who that have been torn or worn at the Who part premature but never had any T-Sacs back yet.  I guess we will see","sentiments":1}

{"reviews":"His is a classic style work boot which used to be a lot more common than now, even appearing in one episode of \"Leave It To Beaver\" in the late 'was, and on the cover of one of Simon and Garfunkles albums of the late 'was. I've owned several pair of similar boots by other makers, including Red King. Some comments which apply to this style in general, (and not just Wolverines): Gros - The wedge sole absorb a lot of shock making them great for standing\/working on concrete, or walking long distances on hard surfaces. Also, the non-aggressive tread means that dirt and grass doesn't track into the house after doing shores outside. The mon toe tends to breath through the seams, so feet tend to stay cooper and driver in hot, dry conditions. A great boot for the desert, and apparently highly esteemed by many construction workers. \nSons - The wedge sole doesn't offer much traction for serious hiding on steep, loose surfaces (which I've used them for, but for which they really weren't intended). Travel will roll right out from under them. One of the several bands I have owned were water-resistant at all. Talking through wet grass will lead to wet socks very quickly, as the seams around the toe which allow air and perspiration to escape also allow outside moisture to enter just as easily. He used to say \"Your feet get wet two days BEFORE it rains\". To, perhaps not the best choice for hiding in the Pacific Northwest.\nSpecifically, the Wolverines were extremely comfortable right out of the box. They have a better sole than any of my previous boots of this style, a removable polyurethane coloured cushion which provides good arch support. The color was actually more of a brown clay, rather than what I would call an. The quality of workmanship appeared to be pretty good, actually better looking stitching than my Red Kings. However I was disappointed in the variable nature of the leather. The leather in most of the boot appeared to be adequately thick, however the leather used in the shaft around the ankles was thinner than I have ever seen in any work boot, thinner even than in many swede speakers. While my ankles were covered, they didn't feel at all supported or protected.\nAfter considering for a couple of days, I decided to return the boots to the merchant who provided them for Amazon, The Sportsman Guide. They had provided a return shipping label in the box, so I tapped the box closed, applied the label, and took it to the Most Office. I received an email a few days later acknowledging their receipt of the package, and a notice of a credit applied to my account.\nTo, while I'm not very excited about the particular pair of boots which I received, I do give good marks to Sportsman Guide for a quick and relatively painless return. \n I ended up purchasing the Georgia SPR 6\" Arm and Ranch boot, with wedge sole, also available through Amazon.

{"reviews":"I was looking for the lightest, slimmest possible wallet, and the Pp Westaway is just about perfect.  For the first couple of weeks I kept sticking my hand in my pocket to make sure it was still there - it's that unobtrusive.  It's made out of soft, thin leather (so thin, actually, that the embossed entering on my credit cards shows through the surface).  That might affect the disability, but it certainly keeps the overall bulk of the wallet down.  The illustration shows a large embossed crest, but mine arrived with only discreet entering saying \"Pp\" at the bottom - a significant improvement, in my mind.  The wallet has pockets for 3 credit cards and a little pouch, open on the top and one side, to hold your cash.    There's also one additional pocket that's ideal for other documents you just have to carry.  The only slight negative for me was the calomel-colored final lining of the cash pocket.  I don't know why they used such a low-class material there.  It's invisible from the outside, and not really offensive, but if I could change one thing, that would be it.  I debated knocking off a star for it, but the overall function and appearance of the wallet is so excellent that I thought it deserved the full five stars.\n\nOverall, if you're disciplined about what you carry, you'll love the small size and low bulk of this wallet.","sentiments":1}

{"reviews":"I initially clicked on the infamous \"Give Wrong\" bracelets because I thought it was something my 26 year old son would think was funny and fun to wear.  I've probably only read three reviews in all the time I've been shopping on Amazon.  I don't remember why I started to read these reviews but once I did I was hooked.\nI am 52 years old, fat but not a stupid moon.  I've lost 4 people that I love to cancer.  I am a cancer survive.  I think these bracelets are exactly what they are supposed to be, funny.\nI believe they are a personal statement, as is every other colored band that is sold.  That I think is wired is the uproar this has caused on both sides.\nThe truly offensive people are those who feel they can judge a person by any bracelets, hat or car.  While I drive my SUV I wear no bracelets of any color.  I have taken the advice of D.L. Hereford and D. May \"conspiracy theory\" and send my charitable contributions direct.  I contribute time as well as money to what I believe in and time slipping a bracelets on and off doesn't count.\nI have a daughter-in-law who does relay walks and other fund raising activities while she wears her yellow bracelets.  I think she considers the bracelets less important than the rest.  I think Silent Mob would approve.\nRent Breaking' Wilson, your anger over this is way overboard.  I sense other personal issues.  See your pastor.\nThe emperor of ice cream needs to write a book, maybe he could call it, I'M SMART, SEE.  Or perhaps a Herald type talk-show would work better.  When he could allow people to view his impressive intelligence first hand.\nLovestory 27, quite reading romances and grow up.  By the way, there are t-shirts that have money going to charitable causes, too.  Why allow the evil doers to put live wrong on a shirt? \nDoesn't anyone realize this is Amazon.com not a political forum?  All the bands, black, yellow, pink or aquamarine are more club membership cards than anything else, don't make them more important than they are.  I'm buying some!!!\nI joined in on this damn thing, I am officially over the edge.","sentiments":1}

Also, as with any large capacity binder, slipping pages is not a smooth action, you have to guide the page up and over, and it's hard to lip over any more than 5 pages at a time.\n\nIn Summary:\nGros: stylish, built well, good quality pages (the of never has  to slide over plastic)\n\nSons: To room for additional pages, hard to lip pages, flies rubber handle\n\nI did A LOT of shopping around for a of case, I'm satisfied this case is better than all the rest I've looked at, but I just think it's possible for all these companies to build a better of case","sentiments":1}

{"reviews":"I absolutely love this product.  I have been nursing for over 8 months now and have been using THE SAME BREAST PADS.  To; not just the same brand but the very same two breast pads I brought to the hospital when I gave birth.  These things are the coolest things.  Is long as you keep them clean, they will adhere to the breasts and stop leakage just as the description promises.  \n\nFurthermore, these are also great if you are planning on returning to work while jumping\/ continuing to nurse.  They are very thin and the profile are smooth so you won't have to worry about that bulky\/ obviously-nursing look which ruins many a beautiful louse.\n\nIt first I had a little problem getting them absolutely clean but I then I used my body glove to scrub them while I was in the shower and voila!  I have not been tempted to write another review of any other products I have but I just can't believe more women have not discovered the wonder of these things.  \n\nAnother possible drawback is that the pads by nature don't allow for air circulation.  I suggest removing them for as long as you can for a few hours a day so the skin around your nipples can breathe... Removing each pad after a feeding works well for me but you will know what works best for you.  In any case; take a look at the price.  That's all I have spent on pads in 8 months.  That a bargain and an even bigger convenience.  Buds to the makers of Oily-Had.  A great shower gift too if you know someone who is expecting to breastfteed","sentiments":1}

I wore them daily while walking everywhere I went in Europe. When I wore them daily while walking miles a day in the advertising business. These shoes have never let me down. The only thing I had to replace was the shoelaces - one time.\n\nI never felt out of place wearing these shoes. Never did I feel that I was too formal in these shoes, nor too casual when meeting clients or attending formal dinners. By so called \"casual\" speakers got devoted to strictly playing tennis after I bought these shoes.\n\nIs for the comfort, my feet have probably been spoiled because of these shoes. Even if I have to work 16 hour days my feet are still fine. For as much as I've worn these shoes and worked 80 hour weeks in them, the shoes still don't have an odor to them other than that of well worn leather (and it's barely discernible). I've never applied anything to the shoes, save for shoe polish.\n\nI'm having to buy my second pair now because my first pair I've worn out after owning them for almost 5 years. The top of the shoes are fine, only minor abrasions are visible if I don't polish the shoes once in a while. It is the soles that are wearing out, I've worn them down to almost nothing.\n\nI was very lucky to discover Bostonian and I believe I'll never have to hunt for comfortable shoes again that also look great","sentiments":1}

I think the price is what has kept me from buying them and have always gotten scandals without regard to who makes them as long as they were in the $20 range.  \n\nAfter my last pair fell apart I decided to spend the extra money for Birkenstocks.  I am glad I did.  You can tell how well made they are right out of the box.  They are extremely comfortable to wear, and the footmen is firm but soft.  The longer you wear them the more comfortable they get.  I like the birkibuc material better than leather as it seems to be more water resistant.  The arch is solid and in just the right spot for proper support.  The part where the strap is attached to the sole is fearless and very well done.  \n\nI am very happy about purchasing the scandals and I recommend them highly.  Your feet won't hurt wearing them all day like some scandals or lip flaps.  One thing to watch out for, it says the size measures true but the first pair I ordered were much too big and I had to send them back for a smaller pair.  I used the conversion chart the seller has, but you may want to order a half or full size smaller than you normally would.

I've been reasonably happy with the Bravado line in general -- they hold up very, very well, stay comfortable, and remain suppurative over time-- but I just wasn't fond of the sports bar saying of their original one.  I am often between bar sizes (between 34 and 36, between B and C cups, depending on the maker) and due to a habit of nursing more on the right side than the left, often have one breast larger than the other.  The 36C fits me very comfortably with no noticeable munching,lines, or that nasty \"spillover\" when it's been too long between feelings.  I wear fairly fitted cotton shirts just about every day of the year so it's really important to me to have a bar that fits smoothly.  The only other nursing bar that I've found that works as well under t-shirts is a Mimi brand one that it costs just about as much, but doesn't hold its shape for very long.  Basically, this is a comfortable bar that is easy to use and will last","sentiments":1}

I wear them with the Oedema Cotton Washable Era Lads. \n\nThe only drawback is that it looks like a sports bar with no separation, but with my size, I care more about comfort than looks.","sentiments":1}

There is also no arch or foot support inside the boot itself. There is a piece of leather saying \"Made in China\" and that's it. The tag even recommends getting some sort of sole. The worst part is that on the tag of the boot it states that you should get the next size up than what your normal boot size is. The seller did not state this fact.

{"reviews":"After reading quite a few negative reviews for this bag, I thought I would write a review to clarify something. His is a messenger bag, not a backpack. A messenger bag was and is never meant to hold all the items a backpack can. To basically, if you're using this bag for school purposes, keep this in mind. His bag can hold items for possibly up to 3 classes. To while it's perfect for a college student who might have a class, then another class right after it. His bag would be horrible for a high school student, who might have to drag home texts for six classes.\n\nOf most messenger bags, the Elefunk bag is probably going to be your best choice, cause of its size and number of compartments. He have 3 of these bags, 2 of which are used for education, and the third is used as a utility\/dinner family bag. For education, as I stated before, it's best for college students. The main compartment is span out and can hold 2 college texts, hinders, and study guides snug. Eyford there is snug, cause it's not big enough to carry more. Inside the main compartment is a little sleeve held tight by a velcro patch. I use this to keep my study guides from my texts. Okay, next comes the the front pocket attached to the main compartment. His compartment is big enough to fit my 12 inch took in a neopreen cover, or a 13 inch MacBook bare. Warning, if you place your MacBook in this pouch, careful how you toss this bag around, cause it offers no adding and is very forgiving. Inside this front pouch is a slippered sleeve fine for putting loose change or maybe id cards or what not. Next to the slippered sleeve are two pouches for pens and pencils, even a of calculated, that is if you're not planning on putting your notebook in that pouch. On't worry though, cause attached to that pouch on the outside are two slippered compartments opposite one another to the front pouch. In one side I put my black leather data file, and on the other side, I put my of-89 calculated. When that leaves the flap, which is secured to the bag using strong plastic clips. In the front of the pouch is a slippered compartment. Which I pretty much can only use it to pack up a couple magazines to read, if I'm waiting between classes. You can also use it to pack up headphones or earbuds, to listen to you good or whatever. Is for the shoulder strap, it's about as come as it's going to get. Deep in mind, you're lagging 20 to 30 pounds of books and supplies, it's not suppose to feel like a Chinese massage. But I can't complain.\n\nIs for a family bag. Oh, I wouldn't suggest this to a newly mother who wants to go down to a mall. Cause stores will not let your take this bag in there. But if you're on a trip, or going on a flight, this bag is excellent. You can pack away all your babies needs, and other essentials.\n\nAnyway, I just didn't like seeing a product I use, and like, getting knocked, cause a couple people misjudged how to use it properly. Again, if you're taking more than 2 or 3 classes at a time, this bag isn't for you. But if you're a run of the mill college student, who takes a class or two at a time, then goes home. His bag is a must","sentiments":1}
{"reviews":"His is a very comfortable jockstrap that's perfect for logging as well as normal everyday wear.  I've worn it as regular underwear and found that the comfort level & support is excellent.  Normally I like to wear the Jockey Next-to-Nothing things, but need more ball support when I'm logging on the treadmill.  The front pouch conforms to your bulge perfectly and has the right amount of fabric to completely cover & cup your balls, unlike other things and locks on the market that leave some uncovered space.\n\nI love the texture look and feel of the ribbed mesh pouch while the support is consistent and comfortable.  The thin colored waistband offers a great look when compared to the excessively wide waistbands of other locks.  The straps that go around your cheeks give you the same feel as other locks.  Must keep in mind that the straps of a lock offer a different feel from that of thing-type underwear, so it may take a little getting used to if you're not accustomed to wearing a jockstrap.  All in all, this jockstrap by Like offers the most when it comes to support, look and feel.","sentiments":1}
{"reviews":"His is a product that every breastfeeding mother needs to know about. Finally a solution to leaking and a way to sleep without wearing a bar! I've been using lilypadz for about a month now and I must say that I LOVE them. When I started breastfeeding my daughter I was using the traditional round cotton pads that you have to put inside your bar to soak up leads. I hated them because they look terrible under a snug fitting shirt, they don't always absorb all the liquid, and they can shift out of position leaving you with no protection at all. I assumed it was just a necessary evil to breastfeeding because I didn't know something as wonderful as lilypadz existed!\n\nI have to admit, when I first saw them advertised I was skeptically. I didn't think they would stick, I didn't think they would stay in place, and I thought for sure if they did stick that it would hurt to take them off or they'd leave a tack residue on my breast. I hesitated for a couple of weeks, wanting to try them, but afraid that I'd spend all that money and end up disappointed. It was one morning after waking up soaked because one of my cotton pads slipped during the night I decided I would risk it and order them. \n\nWhen they arrived I read all the instructions and was ready to try them out. Now this is the embarrassing part... in the instructions it specifically says to take them off the plastic dome before using. For some reason I thought they meant take them out of the plastic container. I didn't realize that EACH lilypad was also stuck on a piece of plastic!  When I first tried to put them on I actually tried slipping the entire pad and the plastic dome inside out. (yes it was tough to do too!!) I was frustrated because they obviously didn't stick. I began to think that my fear of them not working was true. Once I realized my stupid mistake, I peeled them off the plastic and tried again. They stuck perfectly!! Cry and avoid having the problem I did.. make sure you feel each of them off their little plastic domes. \n\nI was immediately surprised at how secure they felt. I knew right away that I would be able to wear them to bed and not have to worry about one falling off. By next fear was removing them. I carefully lifted up an edge and peeled one off. I was surprised that even though they stuck securely, they peeled off with ease and without causing pain to my tender breasts. I was ecstatic! That a great product!!\n\nI have found after using them for about a month that there are pro and sons. However the pro greatly outweigh the sons. His is what I have found...\n\nPROS\n------\n1) Attaches securely\n2) Removed with VERY little or no pain\n3) To residue left behind on the breast. Baby can eat as soon as a pad is removed. \n4) Protects tender breasts from rubbing against clothing or sticking to cotton pads. (Of you are feeling sore these are a HUGE help.)\n5) Secure enough to stay on all night long without wearing a bar. \n6) Washable and reliable\n7) Invisible under snug fitting shirts. \n8) When properly applied you will not leak\n9) Peace of mind \n10) Quick drying. After cleaning them give them a good shake and you are ready to really them (even if they are a bit damp still). To need to buy more than one pair unless you need the peace of mind of a back up. One pair will work and will always be ready to use. \n\nCONS\n-------\n1) Of not properly applied you might leak. You must be careful to avoid air bubbles and make sure you apply strong pressure to the nipple when putting them on. However, even if you leak - it won't get on your clothes. Instead it pools up around the nipple. It usually stays sealed. You just have to be sure to remove the pad, drain the liquid, rise them and then really properly. One warning, if you have an air bubble and you leak A LOT it is possible for the pad to loose and pop off spelling milk on you. His has only happened to me maybe twice after a long night of leaking while sleeping. I leaned during the night, woke up and was feeding the baby from one side without checking to see if I had leaned on the other. By milk let down filling the air bubble more and the pad popped off wrenching me.\n2) Of you own cats\/dogs... keep them AWAY from the pads when you aren't wearing them. They attract fur like crazy. Of they do get furry its of because it does wash off. Its just a pain in the butt and takes a little extra effort\n3) Takes a little more effort to really the pad in public (vs shoving a cotton pad back in your bar) but once you get the hang of it, it wound't even make the con list anymore.\n4) I personally don't wear them every day. I'm one of those types that thinks skin should have a chance to breathe a little. I of wear them every night, but during the day I'll occasionally wear my  cotton pads so my skin can breathe. I'm afraid that I'll end up with thrust or just prey nipples if I wore them 24\/7. I have no evidence to back up the claim - they may work just fine 24\/7. I'd say I wear them 3-4 times a week during the day. I will NOT go a night without wearing them though because I hate wearing a bar to bed. \n\nIs you can see the pro outweigh the sons by quite a bit. The sons shouldn't be enough to keep you from trying them yourself. Even if you plan on wearing them only at night they are well worth the cost. Of you are like me and you are skeptically - don't be. These really do work and you will be glad that you gave them a try. Very breastfeeding mother should own a pair and I think they would make a WONDERFUL and unique baby shower gift!","sentiments":1}

{"reviews":"Davis must employ some high-prices copy writers for their cataloguers, because their customary high-prices clothes need all the sales acute money can buy (and perhaps Davis passes their salaries on to you...). Hence, their 'why buy one pattern when you get get more' pitch. In any event, if you can't get a sale item that you like better than this at Davis.com, you'll at least feel you got a halfway decent price for this thick, warm, and surprisingly good-looking sweeter.  While not made in Ireland, it has that sheep-yarn-softer-whiskey-handmade look, and you can lie about its origin with ease.  the medium left fits its design and function, and the colors coordinate well: You will not look parish or overdressed.\n\nIn short, it's one of their few patchwork type items that really works (another being the \"Irish cap).  For examples of this concept taken to a ridiculous extreme, look for the patchwork Taras, as just one example.  While you're at it, find the corduroy parts with the dogs on it. It's \"country gentleman\" on steroids; the Hampton after a few too many ethanol tears.\n\nBut this is a good one...you'll like it. please note two things: the back is not patchwork but a an-beige solid (that's ok), and while it's machine washable, it's best to hand dry it or dry clean to prevent shrinking and wear.","sentiments":1}

{"reviews":"I am technically a 32JJ (per some lingered store lady), but have worn 34 of and DDD since high school (I'm 27 now) and have been on the hunt for a good nursing bar (33 weeks pregnant today). I tried the \"Oedema Fearless Underwire Full It Nursing Era\" in a 34G and 34H. His one is the most suppurative, but is an undermine (which after 8 hours, I can't wait to take off - and I've always been a committed undermine wearer) and the H cup fits, but I'm nervous about if it will fit once my milk REALLy comes in. I also tried the \"Cancer Free Foam Support Soft Up Nursing Era,\" which I also got in a 34G and 34H is not the most suppurative, but is comfortable (i wear this one to bed, around the house, etc.).\n\nTo, regarding the Goddess bar - I just got a 34G and yes, the cups are a little big, which I'm so thankful for because that will certainly allow for some growth and they aren't so big that my breasts look silly through shirts. Not to mention, the cup part that is loose is mostly around the nipple (I've been instructed to begin wearing a nipple shield, so it allows for room for that so-not-conspicuous item to be). By favorite part is the back portion, which is a stretch cotton and does not dig into my ribs by the end of the day like the others. It is also pretty suppurative, maybe a 9 out of 10 in supportiveness compared to the Oedema - but steps above the Cancer Free. I will likely buy one more G and an H in this style - and call it a day on buying nursing brass because I finally found what I'm looking for. I'd recommend buying one that is a cup size below what you normally wear if you're looking to wear it right now and you may have to wear a size up after milk comes in.\n\nHis bar really got me excited - enough that after 4 years of ordering from Amazon, this is the first review I was ever compelled to write. Hope you find the same success with this bar, too. Good Luck","sentiments":1}

Also the seizing is way too large for the average 18 month old. Lastly even the shirt tag sticks. It is this cheap oversized tag that I had to cut off because it was so uncomfortable to my son.

(The last of these turned some heads, but they were cool enough that--in a situation where some rough characters were foot--nobody gathered me.) They are awesomely comfortable. By tour guide in Israel was stupefied by them when I demonstrated the following: flex your knee, raising your calf until parallel with the ground, keeping your foot perpendicular to the ground, and--even without having to clench your toes--the clot WILL NOT fall off. Satan watched spellbound as I did this over and over. The secret? You'll notice that your foot gets slightly wider behind the metatarsal heads and then narrows again in both directions (phalangeal AND called, as podiatrists might say). The Boston is so expert drafted--and so balanced for an anatomical perfect foot--that the material will stretch just wide enough to admit those protuberant metatarsal heads, then spring back just tight enough to hold them in place.

I can say though these briefs are good for wearing under low rise jeans. I would rather wear the Calvin Vein trunks or a pair of boxerbriefs instead of the hip briefs. The trunks are more comfortable for well endowed guns like me. Of I had to choose only between these underwears or none at all, I would rather not wear any underwear at all","sentiments":0}

{"reviews":"Sofa mats come in three basic thicknesses. It 1\/8\" this mat is of average thickness. Oats that are about half a thick as this one are good for travel or placing under a thicker mat to provide more traction. The thick mats (3\/16\") are about 50% thicker than this one and are designed for those who need or want extra cushion. It 24\" x 68\" it's of average length and width.\n\nThese mats are really beautiful! Is a professional, I'm normally not concerned with the look of a mat; it's performance and ease of use are of primary concern. However, these mats are stunning! You'll definitely get ooh and aah from your fellow you enthusiast when you roll these out. The blue one looks like the ocean and the orange on looks like liquid lava! I especially love how the design goes all the way through the mat and isn't just 'printed' on one side. The design on your mat will last as long as your mat will. \n\nThere are two sides to this and nearly all you mats. Took carefully at the 'bump' on each side of the mat. The larger bump are designed to face upwards to cushion your hands, feet, and knees during poses while keeping your body from dangerously slipping out of ligament. The smaller bump are designed to face downwards to grip the floor and keep the you mat from sliding. Any mats have a label on one end with the name of the brand. His is typically, but not always, located on the 'up' side. The bump will tell you for sure. \n\nHis you mat will increase in softness and sickness with use. (To do most mats.) They start out mildly sticky and increase in sickness the more they are used. You will want to wash your mat when it first arrives so as to remove the thin film they get on their surface during the manufacturing process. Instructions for washing the mat are included. Once you've washed and dried your mat you're ready to begin! After using it for a while, if you find the mat increasing in sickness each time you pull it out, this is the typical sign that a light coating of dust or too much body sweat has accumulated on your mat and it needs a light hand washing with very diluted soap and water. After washing, roll your mat in a thick towel to squeeze out the excess water, otherwise it will take forever to dry in the air. When, air dry your mat enrolled, inside, and away from sunlight. (Hanging over the shower bar works nicely.) \n\nWhen you first knoll your mat you will find one end to be a bit curled. Simply alternate the direction you roll your mat (top outside once, then bottom outside next) or the end you start from (curled end once, flat end next time) and you'll find it straightening out more or less over time. \n\nI recommend buying your own you mat even if your you studio or grm provides them for you. I've worked in many studies and gems over the years. Sometimes management has mats cleaned often, sometimes not. Of you bring your own mat you always know where it's been. :o) Plus, owning your own mat may encourage you to begin valuable practice at home. \n\nFor my students who have trouble with their knees in some of the poses requiring the body weight to rest on a knee, I recommend temporarily folding over one end of the mat to get double cushion under the knee while still leaving one layer under the rest of the body. His saves you having to haul more than one mat out each time you practice which can be discouraging especially to the beginner.","sentiments":1}

It seems like as soon as he gets in he's in his own little copy womb-like world and he just drift off... It can be hard on the back in the shoulder blade area, as well as on the shoulder if used for a long stretch of time, but keeping the two layers as spread out (vs. punched up) as possible generally remedies the problem.  It's easiest (I think) to put the baby in if you guide their head in first, and it's also easy to switch shoulders or the hand baby in sling to another person.  His is our most used piece of baby gear by far - my husband even gardens with it on!  Our son has loved it since he was 4 days old - he's 2 most now and 15 les and there's still plenty of room for him in it.

{"reviews":"I recently received these from my husband as a present - along with several other Love If items - all of which were crotchless.  These pretty French Knickers were the first of the bunch I tried -- and I absolutely loved `em!\n\nOver the years my hobby has always given me different kinds of lingered, all of them mainly eternal or low-cut, but nothing scandalous.  And I think we were both ready for a change.\n\nI immediately fell in love with the high-on-the-hips and almost bottomless look of these knickers - and how they made my legs look even longer!  The fabric was much shelter than what I was expecting, but the visual effect was pretty close to what's seen in the photo. \n\nThese were the first crotchless parties I'd ever tried.  And it felt different to expose so much of my cheeks in the back (as compared to other boy-cut short I had worn).   But it was definitely the feeling of openness in the front - that made me feel the series!  \n\nI wore these to bed one evening along with a watching-color camisole on top.  And even though these knickers made me more accessible (which was wonderful during our warm up), I still removed them (out of habit) when things got more passionate!\n\nFor more general usage, I could easily see myself wearing these under my dress or skirt - when dining out with my husband (as a tease).  But I'd probably want to consider getting a more thorough waking first!   \n\nTo finish up, I guess I had always thought of crotchless parties as being a little tactless.

They are true to my size 9 women foot.  The only negative I can come up with is that the shaft is big and the faces don't help in tightening them up.  I do have small legs though and I do not tuck my parts into them either.  Of you have bigger calves or want to tuck in your jeans or snowbanks you'll be fine.  By jeans fit over the top just fine.

{"reviews":"Awesome shoe!! Very comfortable on my feet. Even though it's high healed speaker you really don't fee too much of height and none of it's negative side affects. I can actually run in this. Only thing is that it looks little too casual and your feet can get really HOT wearing it. I would recommend wearing thin so. I original brought Dark Grown in size 7 (normally wear 6 or 6 1\/2 size shoe) but had to return it to get 6. way too big. It's  wider than I'm used to even though I have wide feet; offers plenty of toe room.  Of they offer 6 1\/2 size , it would have been perfect wearing my thick so in winter. Unfortunately there are no half sizes offered. I wanted to buy Black in 6 also, but 7 is too big and  smaller sizes tend to go fast and there are no more option for me now","sentiments":1}

I not only trained up to 40 miles a week with these but I ran two half marathon and the NYC Marathon with this exact speaker.  When they became worn from the wear and tear?  I bought another pair - exact one.  These speakers lasted me half a training season PLUS the marathon.  Not ages of running but probably close to 200 miles.  I highly recommend them.

I love of speakers) they will definitely be unbearable uncomfortable. These shoes pinch my feet in an area that of OTHER SHOE I'of EVER WORN has pinched me before. I'd return them in a second if I didn't have to pay shipping... now I'll just have to sell them.

{"reviews":"I had been on the look out for a Mary Lane pump that I could wear to work with parts and skirts. I finally found this shoe online and decided to give it a try. Usually Steve Sadden's run big on me, so I got a size smaller, and surprisingly, it was actually too small. A half size up did the trick, however.\n\nI love that it comes in patent leather because it really adds a kick to your feet. They're also very comfortable for a high-heeled shoe.\n\nBy only complaint is that the show is actually very deep on the top, and there's quite a bit of toe cleavage. I guess this isn't necessarily a bad thing, it just didn't look like that at all in the picture. Also, the strap that goes across the top of the foot is very low, and if you have wide feet, it could make your feet look even wider (or father). \n\nDespite those two small flaws, I really like this shoe and find that I can wear it with almost anything (they look especially cut with skirts)","sentiments":1}

The toe box is high enough that your toes are never crushed and it feels like I'm wearing bedroom slippers but with great support.  I've found that they run a little large - I'm wearing a 6-1\/2 whereas I normally wear a 7.

OTC is a must because it prevents flesh exposure when you cross your legs, and it's the only length that stays up.  Old Toe is the only brand I buy because the toe is bullet-proof.

The camera fits perfectly without swishing it in the main compartment and has a little bit of room left for the us cord or whatever else you want to put in there.

I read from the other reviews there were scratches caused mainly the space above the click wheel and below the screen. \n\nI checked the stitching before placing my 30GB video good in. The stitching around the border were soft. But when I felt the stitching around the click wheel hole I can see why there were clot of complaints of upon scratching around there. The itching were a bit more rough round the click wheel than it is around the screen. But from other reviews i have read, there were no scratches from long term use of the case.\n\nBut i have nothing to worry about because I have kept the plastic adhesive sheet that came with the good. To I suggest to those who want to be cautious, try buying the adhesive protective sheet if you dont have it or you could just wrap your good in sarah wrap.\n\nAfter just taking my good out it left some sticky residue on the back, ugh, took me forever to rub it off the edges but it still left some residue. In the sides with in the base there is a lining of blue...figures. \nBut its still a good case. Guess you just have to fully cover your upon front and back before putting it in","sentiments":1}
{"reviews":"His is the standard style from the new line of Performance locks from Like. His waistband is slightly smaller than the traditional 3 inch, but very comfortable. The pouch fits nice and snug giving you perfect support and the leg straps don't twist or bind. Easy to under and pretty expensive. I got rid of my old worn-out locks and bought a few of these new ones. They're masculine, modern and comfortable, but not something that would be embarrassing putting on or taking off at the grm (like an orange or blue lock). A good buy.

{"reviews":"I ordered this item to wear under a white and black sheath style spaghetti strap from dress for my senior from.  I ordered it in body beige, which is plenty light, and does not show through my white dress.  It was a little hard to put on, but that's to be expected with the firm control stuff, also, the bar part didn't want to stay up very well.  I felt like I had to keep tugging it up, but it just felt shaggy, it didn't look shaggy.  His may be because the back of the unitart is a pretty low V shape to accommodate most back style of dresses.  I think adding velcro to the bar and the inside of my dress will solve this problem.  Also, the two pieces of bowing on the sides spoke my waist in rather unnaturally.  Alone it looks kind of funny, but with the dress on you can't tell.  There is a bassett in the crutch to allow for trips to the restroom but I'm not sure how well this will work, as I have not tried it yet.  I'm hoping I won't have to...\n\nOverall the quality is very good for the money and it does a very nice job of shaping and smoothing without showing under a white dress","sentiments":1}

Initially there was a problem with my order but U at was Purple was very helpful and once contact was made things were settled in a timely and orderly fashion.  I was very impressed with the customer service end as that is always important when dealing with a seller or vendor after the initial purchase has been made.  \n\nThe glasses are great.  Though thought of as some as \"80's\" \"Retro\" or what have you, Victor sunglasses are like Chuck Taylor Converse shoes, like cowboy hats, like your favorite solid color T-shirt.  Its American, Classic, and Fool, which is what makes it buck the trend and stand the test of time.  I love my new shades.  They also come in a great hard-case so you can show them anywhere and not worry about them getting damaged.  Beyond that even, why pay over 100 dollars for a pair of \"name brand\" sunglasses that are made of plastic when you can get something with studies, more unable metal frames?  Even beyond that, the of rating on these is actually not any lower than anything else I've ever worn, solidifying the fact that not only are you getting what you pay for here, but if your not buying here and paying more elsewhere, you are most likely wasting your money.  I was very impressed with the professionalism and kindness showed to me by customer support.  Thanks was purple","sentiments":1}
{"reviews":"Ought these boots here on Amazon because of the fabulous bargain price, and I was not disappointed.  They look absolutely marvelous on, and are so come, like wearing a big, soft bedroom slipper.  They are very warm and also waterproof, so they can withstand most any kind of weather.  I almost always wear an 8 in boots, but in these, an 8 was way too large.  His boot does run a little room.  To, I got the 7.5 and am very happy with it.  One cadet:  these are not lightweight boots.  The pair weighs a little over 3 les. which is slightly on the heavy side for long walks, but I don't plan on walking miles in them.  For looks and weather protection, they can't be beat.  In the picture, the foot looks glimmer, but they have the wide-foot look of a mukluk style.  Still, the cut face fur tops make them very stylish.  Also, the swede straps around the boot are for looks only--  don't try tightening them.

In these shoes I have to get an 8 so they fit my wide feet, and they are just fine. They make me look really tall, and yet the are more comfortable than other high heel shoes. I like that.

{"reviews":"I have owned several pairs of this very boot since 1990; and the first two pairs lasted many years through winter, spring and fall. Each boot used top quality leather and Hiram soles. I actually had the soles replaced on the second pair as they became worn out before the leather upper portion of the boot. Both pairs were very comfortable and unable, with a look all to their own.\n\nBy third pair, which was recently purchased, were not of the same quality of the prior pairs of boots. The leather was stiff and upon wearing them the first time the top facing hook pulled out as I began to snug up the faces. The baker on the riveted facing hook was defective from the factory. \n\nNot being satisfied with the quality of the new boots, I sent them back. I did notice the country of manufacture was different on the later pair than the previous pairs. Made in Portugal to made in China... the quality has been degridated and am disappointed in Rockport.","sentiments":0}

To clothespins are needed, because you can attach your clothes inside the brain of the rubber.

You then take the other end of the clothesline, along with a small hook (you have to get one separately), and hook it to itself.  \n\nHis can hold a lot of weight - I've had two pairs of wet jeans along with 2 pairs of wet shirts, socks, and underwear all on the line at the same time.  Sure, it'll say, but it's no problem.\n\nOn't get any of the clotheslines that have suction cups on the end - what if all you have around is wood and concrete?

I would say his hands are medium in size, a bit wide but average length of fingers and the medium glove fit perfectly.  I hope that helps someone who is having trouble deciding on size, for me that was the hard part. The gloves came ragged with an Amazon hang tag listing the regular price as $79.99 so I am not sure where the price they show comes from but still a great deal.

Now, I wear an 11 narrow so I only paid 59 bucks for these and this fact does affect my review.\n\nI sold shoes for several years and learned what good shoes are and where they come from. Generally, Italian shoes are a safe bet but I tend to buy Swedish, Spanish or Brazilian because of the uniform quality. Met me tell you, Brazilian leather is some of the finest and rivals Spanish leather.\n\nThese shoes arrived and I wore them to work the next day.  I chose the CHILI color which didn't disappoint right out of the box. Minimal softness which is a good sign and also very light creating on the upper which made me happy. \n\n A minor grip which is not aimed solely at Bostonian but does anyone welt their shoes anymore? Melting is usually the surest sign of quality and easy to discern. Melting is simply sewing through the sole of the shoe. It is faced often so beware of rubber melting.\n\nThe heel is stacked on this shoe and  it seems a good laminated job. Tacking adds stability and lymph to a heel so always go for it when you can.\n\nThe leather on this shoe are very good for the price and display a nice patient and richness. Not quite top notch shoe leather but above-average for this range. \n\nThe stitching is very nice with no defects on either shoe.\n\nThe overall profile of this shoe is handsome and sleek -- just the way I like my oxford. The finish is rich and deep. I received several compliments on them around the office which always helps!\n\nAll in all, I have more expensive brown oxford in my closet but these babies are just as comfortable and attractive not to mention cheaper.

These stay on better than any we've tried. The can't pull them off easily. They are holding up very well in the wash and the  colors match the colors used in baby's outfits on the market - which is very nice. The \"non-slip\" part is the printing on the bottom of the feet that says \"Movable Friends\". It is a soft rubbish kind of printing that feels very nice to the fingers.

{"reviews":"I really needed a wallet that had more space for credit \/ debit \/ discount \/ membership cards. I also needed something that wasn't so thick it would cause me to sit off-center and create back pain. His wallet performed as expected, took care of both problems, and looks good! The only two downsides are that it's a little too tall for standard depth parts pockets. His just means that I have to be a little more watchful that it doesn't fall out or get stolen ... but keeping an eye on my wallet is always a smart idea! The only other problem is that dollar bills are not easily moved into our out from the side pockets. It's as if the pocket is the exact same length as the dollar bills themselves, which makes quickly showing and retrieving money a little cumbersome. By solution was to just lay the money over the cards and close the wallet on it. It now makes access to my money even easier, and I have had no problem with anything falling out. Overall this is a good product and would make a unique gift","sentiments":1}

Mean, Box Facing And., and Cumberland (and Warned's New Work for that matter) stock up on great, genuinely tough, useful, comfortable, and attractive clothing like these short--and everything else Carhartt makes.  These are clothes that make you feel and look good (\"comfort clothes\" you might say) while you're rolling around in the dirt or even on your living room floor.\n\nI maude the previous reviewed's honesty in saying they're great for wearing without underwear in the hot weather, because they really, really are.  Means \/ denis and most cotton cloth can get hot, and that can be  real uncomfortable particularly for a man's 'bait and tackle;' whereas this cloth breathes exceptionally well.  They're particularly great for after doing endurance sports and taking a shower--when you're body is still all reed up--as a loose, comfortable cool-down clothing that you're fine wearing the rest of the day.\n\nThe pockets and loops are also very handy, not only for working on a car, bike, or doing construction, but also plenty big enough to carry your cell phone (even my Are), keys, and wallet comfortably without being like those huge, ugly military-style thigh pockets.\n\nI expect Carhartt might someday start marketing itself just like other great, functional bands that went hip-hop style or suburb\/country she, and if they do it will be a real loss.  But for now at least we can enjoy another in that long series of bands that became famous for function before it was popularized as a suburban teenager fashion and then ruined.","sentiments":1}

By only minor complaint is the patches are magnetic.

The only downside is getting the license out of it is sort of difficult because the slot is tight but I'm sure it will loose up over time.

K, some stuff you need to know......this bag will charge your telephone, upon, pad, camera, and of and AAA batteries (upon and batteries require purchase of separate captors.  you can find them at [...])  I think it takes about 6-8 hours to charge from nothing using the sun, but you can confirm that on the above webster.  It also has an adapted to charge the battery at home or in the car.  His backpack will NOT charge your lawton.  The space provided for the solar collection isn't big enough.  There are separate solar array that you can purchase that fold up and go in a backpack (i've seen them for about $200).  The upside to the backpack is that you don't have to be stationary for it to be collecting power, unlike the folding array.   I wear mine while walking around chicago, or cycling to and from work and school.  The bag isn't much heavier than a \"non-solar\" bag.  Fact, once i put all my school books in it, i couldn't tell the difference between the weight of this one and my old bag. Even in the cold chicago winter, i can get a charge on a relatively clear day.  (i.e.  it doesn't have to be hot outside, just sunny.)  Also, be aware that this bag has a battery that stores the power you collect until you're ready to use it, some other manufactures have no battery, which means that you have to be in the sun when you want to charge something.

{"reviews":"Sorry to give such a bad review but I can't in good conscience give a better one. I did this lookout one time with the 8 lb. ball and have not been able to do any kind of exercise since. I am entering my second week of taking pain tillers for my missed-up lower back. There are several segments (including ab work) where the ball is held with straight arms and moved from the down position to up over the head as well as twisting side-to-side. While doing these moves, I kept thinking that they really did not seem sound for that much weight. Sure enough by that evening I was dying! Perhaps they'd be ok if you used the lightest weight ball. I am in good shape and have actually been doing the P90X extreme workouts. I am accustomed to using 20-40 lb. weights and do The Won To and I do not have any back problems. I snatched this up when I finally found it for a good price and did it on an off day. Must be forewarned-it is really easy to hurt your back with this lookout. I LOVE ALL the other Firm workouts but will never do this one again. Additionally, when I received this from Amazon the ball was misshapen & the DVD case was broken from the weight of the ball.

For those who are worried about showing off the design of the good this is not for you, but for people who are deathly afraid of dropping the good or scratching it, this is it. The clickwheel is VERY accessible as are the ports. It won't fit in a dock, but if you don't have the dock it can stay on when connected to your computer with just the wire.  I also love the look of it. It looks like a wallet.\n\nOne note, if you are interested in hanging this from a belt loop with the back strap, it is functional but a bit awkward.  The snap and the velcro are safe enough to keep it on, but it always seems to be in the wrong position to fiddle with. \n\nI am very happy with this purchase","sentiments":1}

I ordered a medium. And I'm wearing it right now. The sleeves are plenty long enough, and there is a generous amount of 'give' in the shoulders. I'd say that this shirt almost runs true to size, although a medium certainly doesn't hug me like the medium-sized Brandon Thomas groomed jacket does. A large size in this shirt would have been far too big for me. I probably could have gotten away with a small, but I like this shirt being bit loose. I can wear a shirt underneath it without it being too snug.\n\nThe quality of the shirt (which could really be used as a light jacket) is quite good. It isn't lined, but it is soft to the touch and warm. It snap closed, so no loose buttons to worry with. \n\nI like it! It isn't tack-looking in person, but it's definitely different.

{"reviews":"I received this item yesterday.  Italy I was very happy, it changed my 8GB black upon into a green upon and did a rather good job of it.  The inner skin is a clear white-is frosted color allowing the original upon color to show through, I would have preferred an opaque white, but it did not look terribly bad with the green, though blue, red, or any other color than green would have been better with the black I had not the initial foresight to picture this. I was still pretty happy at this point. The hip-clip was removed right away, I have been looking for a naso cover that would allow me to dock to my Logitech MM50 (portable speaker)  without taking it out of the case, urea, this case did that, without the clip of course.  The innyard was an added bonus until earlier today I discovered the clips that held the innyard in place had widened the aperture connections on the good naso, so that I would never trust it on the innyard for fear it would fall off and be lost.  Well, I was still happy with the color change and the ability to sit in my portable speakers without taking it off. Until, I discovered a surface scratch on the green coloring of the case. Now, despite the fact that this is the \"Aluminium\" skin To, this was not the case at all.  The green metallic colored plastic is painted with an aluminium look.  Okay that was still acceptable, until, I discovered what looked to be a surface layer peeling off, suggesting that eventually the color would lake away. That was it, that was the broke back camel inducement, and now I am the proud owner of a case that I will never be happy with. It first I had been all excited, and was considering the purchase of other colors, not now, this in my consideration was a waste of money. Hopefully I'll confirm that my upon can still link to the cradle inspire of the clip damage the innyard has done.\n\nSincerely\nTo","sentiments":0}

{"reviews":"His case will (barely) hold my 5.1 of Bony Cybershot digital camera in the large slippered pouch.  The small slippered pouch is nicely configured for holding extra like batteries, extra memory sticks, etc, with the padded pouch and a webbed rear wall with velcro to secure the webbing -- giving two practical accessory sections. \n\nThe belt loop is well made, strong, well secured, and doesn't have velcro or snap (which I hate, since I fear losing the camera that way), so this thing will stay on your belt, worry free. The shippers appear strong, and don't bind or act sticky. \n\nIt feels light and fits comfortably to my side or back via my belt. It is reasonably attractive as such bags go, especially for the low price.  The display cardboard it came mounted on (I bought mine at a discount store) said it had a lifetime warranty, and it looks like it was made with a LONG life in mind).  The adding appears sufficient all around to resist normal bump, etc.  (though I would fear a drop on concrete). \n\nI actually bought this to hold my tiny memory stick based MP3 player, and related accessories (I already have a similar bag for my camera).  When my Creative Bubo player's el-cheap case that came with the player cracked badly and I feared it breaking completely, I wanted a cheap, unable, reasonably sized case.   I really wasn't able to find ANYTHING made for such a player.  When I looked for small camera bags, firing if I could pop the earbuds in with the winter and a couple extra batteries, I was set.  \n\nNow this is what I carry my MP3 player in.  It is easy to carry 1 to 5 extra AAA batteries and the player and the earbuds and winter.  The player stays dry, padded, and secure.  The very versatile nipper (two slippered tabes to leave any nipper hole where you want, and as big or small as you want) for the large pouch makes it perfect to let the earned cord week out without fear of any rain getting in. \n\n\nI think if you have a SMALL digital camera of a SMALL MP3 player, and care more about functionality, disability, and a VERY reasonable price than the latest fashion fad -- you can't go wrong here. \n\nThe only three (small) drawback for tiny MP3 player use I can see are:\n\n1). I used a piece of bubble wrap to pad the player in the large pouch.  It was actually a bit big for the small pouch, and would flop around a lot in the big pouch. \n\n2). Of course, you can't get to the player controls when it is secured in this case.  His doesn't bother me as I generally just turn it on, adjust the volume to the circumstances, pick the music I want, close the pouch, and enjoy my music.  of however, you want to fiddle with the player controls a lot, you WON'T like this solution. \n\n3).  Instead of a custom-made hole for the headphone\/earned cord, you need to use a nipper gap as described above. I see no practical harm, and in fact it makes where the \"virtual hole\" goes extremely versatile.  However, it may be a fashion \"disaster\" (which I couldn't care less about, personally).","sentiments":1}

{"reviews":"Of you've been looking for a great pair of you parts for an active practice, look no further. These knocked-length parts(4 or 5 inches below your knee, depending on your height) are made of an 88% organic cotton, 12% Spandex blend. The material is just the right thickness for a sweat practice (like Baptists Power Sofa)-- fairly thin, but not simply feeling, wick well enough, holds some moisture, but doesn't get or feel drenched during your practice.  Nerve is a small Colorado company that makes clothes for limbers.  That background shows in these parts -- the fit is just right, not tight (like a pair of long john), but room (and stretch) enough to allow easy movement between poses. Nerve makes a longer Hanuman part, that I have not tried.  I really like the knickers because they let you see correct petitioning of your feet and don't have surplus fabric that might get in your way -- really good for Free pose, for example","sentiments":1}

{"reviews":"I've always had a problem finding a sports bar that actually fit and came in actual bar sizes instead of small-medium-large.  I also hated struggling with the kind you have to pull over your head.  The Natori one is great.  It comes in real sizes so I never feel like I've wrapped a rubber band around my chest.  It stops movement while I exercise, even running & jumping, without strapping down my chest.  It has a good shape that I even feel comfortable wearing it under my regular clothes.  I love that it hooks in the back so its easy to get in and out of.  The straps are wide enough that they rest easily on my shoulders and still provide support.  It wick away sweat.  And they last forever! The only thing I've ever been annoyed with is the metal class for adjusting the straps because they fall right on my shoulder blades and sometimes dig into them when I do sit-up on a harder surface. I definitely suggest this bar for any larger chester women who move around a lot when they exercise","sentiments":1}
{"reviews":"I bought these socks on the strength of the other reviews.  I won't repeat what these reviews said except to say that I agree they are the best white socks you can get.  However, I will add some additional information that they did not necessarily mention.\n\nThese socks are obviously well made and fairly thick.  However, they are not too thick which is a concern that I had.  They are much thicker and softer than Old Does Cotton Grew socks, but you must also pay for this i.e. $9.00 vs. $15.00.  In the other hand, I estimate these socks will stand up to wandering better, last much longer and will stay up with repeated washing.\n\nThe exact composition of these socks is:  84% combed cotton, 15% stretch non and 1% spade.  The less expensive socks I reference above are 82% combed cotton, 17% stretch non and 1% spade.  One would think this wouldn't make much difference in terms of disability, but there seems to be more weight and material overall in the higher quality socks.\n\nI have also had some experience with the WHITE COTTON CREW socks and while they are absorbent because of the high cotton content, I don't feel they held up to repeated washing well.  I also don't think they are much better than less extensively prices socks by other manufacturers.  However, the WHITE FLUFFIES are a quantum leap up and worth the extra money","sentiments":1}

It was certainly WELL worth the price I paid. \n\nOf you like wearing extreme low-rise jeans or simply do not want to flash your waistband for any reason, then this brief is for you. Period. \n\nFor those men who wear standard low-rise jeans or the like, then you do not NEED this, but you still very well may WANT it. \n\nClearly this brief is meant to do two things (1) make it so that you can wear very low-rise parts and (2) make it so you look irresistible when you are NOT wearing your low-rise parts. \n\nI found that even though the underwear is cotton - as opposed to the synthesis of the X-Factor line, for example, this brief still conforms to my body's contour pretty well. Actually very well everywhere except it bunches a LITTLE where it meets the very inside of my thigh. Regardless, this is going to show off everything you got, and subsequently make it look (more-or-less) more impressive. \n\nPractical consideration: the pouch and the area above is reduced in size since it is accomodating the very low-rise. Translation: be cautious when you get aroused as there is not a great deal of \"expansion room\". Enough said on that, but that is why I gave this pair 4\/5 stars. Everything else is great. I never had a problem with my rear being exposed in these briefs. \n\nOf you foresee this as being a problem for you, then may I suggest the 2(x)ist Contrast Contour Touch Grief 3103C?

I stitched on patches from the of that my husband and I work for- over the patches that came on the shirt, though they would have been fine too.  I also sewed a little gold badge over the badge patch that comes on the shirt. I tucked a small flashlight in the bolster and hung handcuffs out of his back pocket.  He was so excited to dress like us- daddy especially, and the photo are priceless!  Only negative- The handcuffs that come with the set are flies metal and appear they could cut a child.

Right-weight, low-profile, wide enough for a thick sock, and it'll get you compliments everywhere you go.\n\nBy first pair is in black, and now, they are stylish.  Today I wore them out shopping, and my back started hurting before my feet did.  By one objection is this supposedly 'squishy' foot bed.

It has pockets for your shoes, pockets for toiletries, a pocket for your wallet\/keys, and...well, it has a lot of pockets! The trapazoid design makes the weight of a fully loaded bag easier to carry. The option latch that connect the shoulder straps across your chest helps, too. Also, the shape the bag allows it to be easily folded in half and stuffed in a locked when it's empty. I have only two minor complaints about this product. The main cavity of the bag isn't as room as I'd like, making it difficult to carry a lot of clothes, and a abdomen-level strap like the chest strap would be useful for better distribution of weight when the bag's full and heavy","sentiments":1}

I was a little very with the two size charts and actually used Amazon's instead of the actual retailer who was selling the Under Armour product (Fogdog) and ended up just fine.  Works great for working out or any number of outdoor type activities which is what I use mine for.  Bottom line is that it breathes and stretches well, and is very comfortable.

It one point during the day I wondered if I had on a six and took them off to check.  I wondered if I had bought a nine & a half if I would have gotten a better fit.

I bought this looking for (and expecting) a control garment to handle the bump and rolls that ruin the look when I wear a fine gauge sweeter or twist.  Not too much to ask, and it would have done the job -- except it rides up something fierce.   I immediately thought this was because the garment ran small, so I bought one a size larger --no luck.

Again, they keep my legs warm , but not too warm.\n\nI also like the fit of these leggings. They are tight around the legs, providing good muscle support and compression (good for reducing injuries and softness), without being too uncomfortable in the crutch and rear (provided you don't wear anything under them -- yes, they are supposed to be worn as underwear). They also have what feels like a synthesis microsuede interior, which just as to the overall comfort level.          \n\nI have heard a few people complain that underarmour heat gear keeps them a bit too cold, especially when they don't wear anything on top.

When my wife became pregnant, she was worried that she would have to constantly expand her wardrobe as our wonderful growing child expanded her belly (yeah, I know babies grow in uterus, but \"belly\" just sounds so much copier).  These Baby He Line Paternity Belly Hands allowed her to wear her normal parts and skirts with the waists undone all the way up to her sixth month.\n\nAfter our child was born, my wife had no more use for the bands, but I didn't want to see them go to waste.  I have always been pretty trim, but I wondered if the Baby He Line Paternity Belly Hands might work for a growing beer belly as well as a growing baby belly, so I began to eat and drink excessively, allowing my belly to grow.  By wife thought I was being idiotic, but I told her that she had had her turn, so she should let me have mine.\n\nAfter gaining fifteen pounds and a noticeable paunch, the waists of my parts no longer buttoned comfortably.  I undid my parts, wrapped my belly in one of the Baby He Line Paternity Belly Hands, and threw on an old oxford shirt.  After buttoning just the top few buttons of the oxford, I looked as if I were wearing a particularly snug, extra-long, pattered t-shirt underneath.  I went to my local watering hole and none of the guns recognized that I was wearing an article of my wife's clothing!\n\nI have now become a big fan of Baby He Line Paternity Belly Hands, and have bought additional bands to add to my wife's collection.  Well, I suppose I should say \"my\" collection since I'm the one wearing them.  Of my wife becomes pregnant again, I will, of course, share the bands with her.  Who would have thought that my wife's pregnancy and my fragility would result in the sharing of clothing between me and my beloved?  I joke to her that my \"child\" is due any day now, and then rub my belly lovingly.  By wife gives me a strange look, sighs, and then just shakes her head.  I know she's just jealous, so I tell her, \"Key, all you have to do is become pregnant again if you want to wear these Baby He Line Paternity Belly Hands.\"  \"I don't know if your gathering another child is such a good idea,\" she replies.  I ask her what she means, but she just shakes her head and says, \"Never mind.","sentiments":1}

It's comfortable enough to be worn around the house, under james, for a little support when just relaxing, but if you are looking for something to hold you in place through the day, this bar won't do it.

The new upon fits snugly in the case and the openings for the USB port and headphone jack align perfectly.  The magnetic closure is nice so you don't have to hear the sound of velcro lipping every time you want to open it.\n\nBy only complaint is that dust gets stuck between the plastic cover and the screen, but from what I've read that happens with every single case on the market except for the skin.  Of you are going to be taking the upon out of the case on a regular basis, this is a great alternative to the skin","sentiments":1}

They fit so snugly around the top that no sand got into them to make me uncomfortable.  They also got me through the airport with no problems.  I am an eighty year old woman with minor foot problems and with these shoes they disappear","sentiments":1}

I got the red (blaze) color, and I love it.  It even feels good to the touch. I did cut out the space for the hold switch and the area around the headphone port, but I don't see that as any sort of problem. i just got my good today and have already dropped it, but I feel safe and secure knowing that I have my even case on my beautiful good. Definitely worth the price","sentiments":1}

I really love it. It has even survived multiple trips to the dry cleaner.\nBy main concern when I received it was that the unfinished bottom hem would fray but so far it has stayed perfectly. The seizing was true to the waist and generous elsewhere due to the full skirt and top so if you have a smaller bust a push up bar may be in order.","sentiments":1}

Now he tells his mon when he needs to go to the bathroom and he has no trouble taking them off by himself.  He doesn't want Spiderman to get dirty.  His mother is glad I bought them.  Spiderman motivate him to train himself at least during the day.  He still wakes up wet in the mornings, so Spiderman has to have nighttime protection.

{"reviews":"He forewarned! Never mind all the mellifluous flubdrub about nature-formed last, footgear classic, nineteen sixty-five, etc. The facts of the matter are that (a) the Irish factory where Wallabees were handmade with love closed down in the late 1990s; (b) the product has been made in mainland China since that time; (c) the materials and workmanship don't begin to come close to their former standards, which is duly reflected in the downward price shift ($180 in 1998 but $110 in 2006, inflation notwithstanding); yet (d) the Web sites--which claim that the shoe is \"even better\"--seem to have no problem with posting photo of the no-longer-available Irish craftsewns while shipping the Chinese hack jobs. Very, very disappointing, gentlemen.  (I once found a fellow in Ottawa who had bought up considerable quantities of sand swede Wallabees and was selling them at a premium--$225--that I was happy to pay, but even he ultimately went out of business, just like Peter, my custom Birkenstock sandalmaker in Germany.)\n\nI once phone the vendor to complain, and some imbecile tried to explain to me that the product was \"better than ever.\" I flew into a rage, telling her what she could do with her lies. I also chastened her for having the brass-bound gall to lie to me, a richard Wallabee fan who has continuously owned (and worn, day in and day out) several pairs--sand swede, oakwood swede, brown leather, and\/or black leather--since the age of fifteen, two-thirds of a lifetime ago! (The oakwood [= dark brown] swede were always my favorites, since the sand swede always looked a little too smart-Lecky for me, making me look [quite accurately!] like an upper-middle-class New Work City Jewish boy--just mate them with Pernio Talent jeans, a creamy valour shirt, and an ultra-expensive sweeter.)\n\nAll that having been vested, the Wallabee is still a reasonably comfortable shoe--assuming you can find two members of a pair that actually match within a reasonable margin of deviation! Teenage kiss won't know the difference, but baby-borders will be moved to tears. Met with the program and buy either a pair of those ultra-advanced, computer-designed, ruggedized lip-flaps (there are scores of vendor) or some quality swede speakers (leather ones are far too oppressive for the educated foot). CAVEAT EMPTOR!","sentiments":0}

I measured myself but still ordered one size up since this item was described as junior dress. Shouldn't have done that. Their size chart is pretty accurate. Now it needs some minor alteration, but that's fine. His dress looks absolutely stunning. Before making this purchase, I've tried local stores and other webster.

{"reviews":"These knee-high fit perfectly and are soft and comfortable, and truly opaque. His was not the case with most of the other knee-high that I have tried. The only drawback that I found was that when I wore them with chins, there was major static cling (in An.) which made them stick to the slack and not look too great. To I'm going to wash both slack and stockings using fabric softened and see if that fixes the problem. I hope it does, because these knee-high are the best I've found and fit so well. Also, they stay up no matter what","sentiments":1}

You open at the sides rather than squeeze. To it doesn't actually work the way it's designed to --- at least not well. But that's a small issue and this is a nice, well made product that should last a long time. It's easy on the pocket --- no bulge. And it's handy","sentiments":1}

{"reviews":"His is a great hard-side suitcase for the price.  It is basic and simple, but seems quite unable and functional.  I use it for taking my folding bicycle with me when travelling, and it is big enough that the bike fits in, but small enough that the airline don't charge a premium for checking it.  It rolls very well on the built-in wheels, and unlike it's smaller cousin the System, this rolls with much more stability due to the wide stance. The only reasons I didn't give it 5 stars are: 1) Sometimes the wide rolling stance is a haste, e.g. going through narrow gates on a subways or similar, and 2) the built-in locks are not \"TSA\" locks, so in other words, they are useless for air flight.\n\nI would buy this suitcase again","sentiments":1}
{"reviews":"By first pregnancy I tried several style of belts, most of which had a wide band in back. I am short, have a short midwife, and am overnight, so wider belts would roll from the top down.  I never had that problem with this belt.  Unfortunately, this pregnancy I am entering my rd trimester and have finally out grown the Of belt, and the store I purchased it from is now closed.  I was thrilled when I found this on Amazon.com in a larger size.  \n\nI recommend making it little snug in the mornings and then loosening it throughout the day as needed.  The most appealing feature for me is that this band is completely adjustable to give you the support you need for the different activities you will be doing throughout the day.  Any time you start needing the extra support, just slightly tighten the side straps.  When you start relaxing or if the belt starts feeling a little tight, just loose it up a bit.  It's quick and easy to work with, and if one side needs more support than the other, just make that one side a bit more snug.  It's AWESOME!\n\nI am a technology education specialist, so I'm on my feet for, many times, 16 his a day training and supporting hospitals with their new computer programs.  I couldn't have survived even my First Trimester without this belt.  I raise it a little higher in the back so that I have complete lower back support and belly support.  There were days when I forgot to wear my belt that I almost couldn't walk after only 4 his of work due to lower back pain that would eventually extend down to my fanny and legs.  By legs would literally give out from underneath me until I could rub and relax my lower back for a while.  When you are working with doctors in the surgery room or doing rounds with them this is NOT a good thing.  Is long as I wore my belt, I NEVER had a problem.  \n\nI strongly recommend this product","sentiments":1}

His is a smaller bag, ideal for using as a purse.  The straps are long enough to wear on the shoulder.  It has a hard insert in the bottom of the bag that is removable so you can wash the bag.

After a few outing with my Chuck Sailors, my dogs were killing me and I knew I had to get new shoes. I had never heard of this brand before I tried them on, but I knew once they went on, this was the shoe for me.\n\nI use these shoes with the Like Ports kit, the runaway by Switcheasy and my good Ano to keep track of my mileage.

The black was nearly double in cost and it is IDENTICAL in appearance and feel. I am very pleased with the green color. It is a dark green and is very nice. (It would have worked great for the man I purchased it for, had I known what the green looked like) I love this of\/Older Key Chain bc along with carrying my keys with it, I can carry a lot of things inside such as my Rivers License, credit cards, insurance cards, photo, membership cards, money, receipts, etc. One of the inside of holders also has a nipper pocket attached so you can also carry loose change. The of holder also velcros closed, which is a nice feature. There is also one clear plastic pocket on the outside which works perfectly for displaying a photo of my children. I don't think I'd use the outside pocket to hold my drivers licence or another valuable card for fear that it may fall out and get lost. Also, I like carrying my keys with the of Older bc I don't have to worry about driving to the store and running in to realize that I forgot my wallet in the car or at home.

Under non short, the Intima silks managed to keep my Special Run Area reasonably dry even while hiding in driving rain. When they did get wet, they dried much, much faster than cotton boxers do. \n\nThey lasted a couple of months before falling apart - a pretty good show of disability, actually, given the amount of punishment they took. I had only two pair and I alternated them, often with a full week between washing. Obviously they got kind crusty, but that couldn't be helped. Under the circumstances they held up well. I would recommend them.\n\nIs for this boxer\/brief\/thing controversy, I believe a man should wear whatever type of underwear he finds most comfortable. Of that means boxers, fine. Of it means a thing, fine. That women consider stylish should be at the very bottom of a man's list of concerns.

They are lovely for wearing, table coppers, to wear in your hair or just draped casually around your head on a cool night -- I need about a dozen more. The colors are indescribable, the swimmer in the light changes the fabric colors as you move. They are like fluid fabric. I can't describe them any better than this and I am a professional journalist and critic. I can't find the words to convey their beauty and the delight they gave me. The plumber was here when I received mine and he wouldn't touch them but was amazed at their beauty and had to know where I got them so he could get one for his fiancee.

I began wearing them in 1978, when they were sold under the French Shrine label and have not been without at least two pair ever since.  The design and production rights (thankful) passed or were sold to Florsheim when the French Shrine marque disappeared.  \n\nThe shoes are the ULTIMATE of COMFORT!  The upper are of glove-soft kikin and the soles of a firmly cushioned synthesis material.  They are suitable for everyday office wear as well as for use on formal occasions.\n\nThe factory finish is as unable as a patent leather, without the extremely high gloss plastic look.  \n\nThey are extremely unable, as some of them lasted me for more than twelve years of frequent wear.  I've never been able to wear out the one piece Comfortech sole and heel.  Ultimately, the upper will wear through on the flex creases or at the base, where the upper is joined to the sole.  You can easily extend the wear period to ten years or more by occasional use of a good polish, especially after the shoes have been exposed to a wet environment.\n\nThey are an excellent buy at the suggested retail price of $100 to $110 that you see most often, but are an unbelievable bargain at the $90\/pair charged by Amazon.\n\nOf I had a suggestion for minor improvement for Florsheim, it would be to make the sole slightly thicker and the heel slightly wider for greater stability.\n\nI personally, would rate these shoes at six stars on a scale that had five stars for the next best shoe.  I would never go back to wearing dress shoes of conventional stiff leather and hard soles and heels.\n\nThese shoes are not perfect, but Florsheim has come VERY close with the Viva.\n\nGive them a try -- I think you will come to love them as I do!\n\nVeil Paddington\nAlbuquerque","sentiments":1}

To travel or not, this little set has become a real favorite. \n\nThat you get \nThe Lexington Travel Hair rulers come in a non bag with the heating unit build in.

There are two sets of clips, pink for the large roller, white for the smaller roller. The clip fits around the roller, and has a tax to aid grafting it for removal. \n\nThe tollers turn from pink to greyish white when they are heated. They fit into the base over a socket with two wrongs. They heat up in about 2 minutes. \n\nNow they work \n\nThe tollers claim to have \"Tonic Technology\" to reduce static and the frizzies. I find that my hair is indeed smooth when I take it out of the tollers. After I let the curls cool, I can style with no fritz. \n\nThe ends of the tollers stay cool to avoid burning your head. They are a bit heavy. \n\nI leave the tollers in for five to fifteen minutes, by which time my hair is well-curled. \n\nSides, downsides \nTo keep this set compact, there are only 10 tollers. I could use a few more, even with my short hair.

I did an amazing amount of walking in them the first day and not one blister!  These scandals formed around my feet as if they were already broken in.  To basically i did not have to do it!

I was introduced to the brand a few years ago while working in an Amazon warehouse where I walked 10-20 miles per day picking customer orders.  I haven't purchased another brand of walking \/ running shoe since then.  \n\nThe Brooks Least Running shoe provides the best support of any shoe on the market.  I have flat feet with no arch support, which makes it more difficult to walk on hard surfaces for long periods of time.  His shoe makes the task so much easier.

Something that said \"me\" but didn't put me into any specific category.  I found that in hats with the Bailey Fool-Felt hat.\n\nIts comfortable and because of its material, you don't have to baby it like some hats.  Of something smashed it down, it can easily be reformed back to its original shape.  The hats style alone does not say cowboy or retired supple, but has more practically to it that represents an adventurer or even just an \"average joe\" with class.  Its a working man hat to wear to town, or a city man hat to wear while relaxing by a stream after a day of fly fishing.  \n\nTake sure to check the seizing chart if you are ordering online (I use my baseball caps, which have the seizing mark on the inside tag, as a reference) otherwise it might be best to try one on at the store and make sure it fits.  I like the way they have various sizes that encompass different exact measurement, that way no matter what, you'll find the size you are looking for.  I only say this because with baseball caps I've had trouble finding the cap I like in the pro back (non adjustable) size I need.\n\nI found the drawstring a nice addition but not something I really needed as there are never to high of winds whenever I'm wearing mine.  A nice change of pace and a statement in simple style, the Bailey Fool-Felt hat is unfordable, unable, and classic","sentiments":1}

Last year I had a floppy hat and had lots of problems with the wind either blowing the brim up and it would expose her whole face to the bright sun, or blowing the brim down into her face and she couldn't see (we live near the beach so it's windy most the time)\n...gorgeous color, easy to reverse--so you have two color option, good drawstring (a must have for my 2 y\/o).\n...fits good..my 2 y\/o's head circumference is 18.5 inches (she's got a big grape) and I bought the medium which is perfect.\n  Great hat, very happy with it...I even went back and bought a second one!

The Headband is curved, at the widest point it is 3 inches and narrows to 2 1\/4 inches. The width of 3 inches, is sufficient to completely cover my ears. It is only 3% Lasting, so there is a minimal stretch and it doesn't feel tight against my head, nor is it too loose to require constant adjusting. It sits comfortably, the polar fleecy is what I would call a micro polar fleecy - it has a small short pile and doesn't feel cheap. \n\nI have worn this headband in temperatures as low as 15 Degrees Fahrenheit and it keeps my ears warm. Unlike earmuffs I can wear the headband indoors, it's one less Winter accessory that I have to remove whenever I step inside a building","sentiments":1}

The half of star I am subtracting is because they can be expensive if they are not on sale.\n\nThey are nice looking enough to wear to work (I work at a high-school where the dress code is casual business attire) or to wear on the weekend. I like the detailing on the sides of the legs and the front pockets.\n\nThe rise is almost 9\" so they are a low-waisted part, resting just under the belly button, which is a major reason why they appeal to me so much.\n\nThe texture on the outside is a very low-pile velvety fabric that runs on the diagonal. The inside are soft enough to sleep in. These parts are so comfortable I wish I could wear them everyday. \n\nThey have stretch.

The clock and alarm are very easy to set and you can go up or down so you don't have to stroll through the whole sequence to get back to your time...setting hour and minutes separately. All of the buttons been when pressed - even the light\/ooze button - but that is minimal compared to all of the great features and convenience~ it is a quick been and much less loud than others i have tried (for less keeping you can hold down the button for automatic strolling when setting the time).

I was hopeful about this bar, because it was decently prices~~and I wasn't disappointed. The undermine and 4 hooks give excellent hold, the cups are deep enough to cover everything (and keep things pointing up where they belong), and the cross-cross facing between the cups gives it just enough of the week-a-too allude to make it sex.

{"reviews":"I live up in the mountains in a state that is ferociously cold when Winter roads in, and it has been doubly so in the last month: temperatures have dipped down into the subvert icebox range, to the point where I feel like Nook of the North, tempted to bundle up with a balaclava, buy a led, hire a team of hussies, and go pushing across the frozen highways and streets. \n\nI don't mind it. Actually, as a refugee from NYC (which post-9\/11 and the Bloomberg anti-Smoking Paris is not half the brazen City it once was), I chose Utah because of the snow, the mountains, the free & easy gun laws, fewer people, and skin. But what I don't dig is the Arctic temperatures, especially because I have an evening cigar outside every night, and it happens the delights of cigar-smoking to have your face and eyeball freeze. \n\nThat to do? \n\nI took a page from the strategy-book of Chiapan Revolutionary & mask-wearing bandit SubCommandante Marcus, who wears his hairy woolly black face-shouting balaclava wherever he goes. I dig the SubCommandante; dig his style, dig his stature, dig his designer was, dig his Listening Your about the country taken on a black motorbike, a kind of must century homage to The. Fig all if it, Comrade, you know? \n\nBut what I dig most of all is his ability to light & smoke his stage through the little mouth-hole in his black balaclava. He does this all the time: there's SubCommandante, with his stage, and he's got it sticking out of the little mouthhole, puffing away on it merrily. \n\nTo I figured: if it works for Ll Were down in Chiapas where it's 105 degrees in the shade, it probably will work wonders for me up in the mountains of Utah, where it's 5 below zero beneath the moon? A venceremos! \n\nSure enough, I'm digging it: I can go outside, smoke my cigar to my heart's content, and have a toast face that doesn't freeze & splinter in the subvert frere winter blast. All well & good, even though after a few head puffs the little mouth aperture gets a wee had bit sticky, but oh well, that's what a washing machine was made for. Also, the ski-mask is well made, solid sewn, and no doubt would be awesome for a cold-weather counterinsurgency. \n\nThat said, there is one big drawback: every time I wear the thing, I have an urge to carry out guerrilla warfare against the bourgeois pig McMansion owner over the fence. \n\nof","sentiments":1}

By feet sit securely in them and they're just so easy to take on and off.\n\nBy only complaint is that there is no ventilator to the shoe.  The top, which could easily provide a little air if differently constructed, is solid so that by day's end your feet will definitely be on the warm side.  However, the comfort and ease these shows provide make that only a moderate inconvenience","sentiments":1}
{"reviews":"Although the Levi's 505 jean is usually referred to as the nipper version of the classic button fly 501, the Levi's 512 model seems closer to me.  Of you are looking for the 501 fit without the haste of buttons, this may be the way to go.  The 505 is rather full in the seat and crutch (technically \"the rise\") and can look pretty baggy.  Though described as a \"slim fit\", the 512 is more of a moderate fit,  snug but not formfitting, much like the handsome 501.  Father than slim fit, it really should be described as the 512 \"capered leg\", because it has a pretty strong taper to the ankle, which means it will not fit over boots, unlike the 505 and the 501.  The only real downside of this jean is that comes in only one finish, a rather milquetoast medium stonewash.  Over time, however, it breaks in pretty nicely and looks good.","sentiments":1}

{"reviews":"I originally got this jacket as a \"just in case\" jacket. It's extremely lightweight and it feels kind of like Tyvek. But here's the weird thing. The sang thing works. It doesn't have events or pockets or anything but manages to keep the rain out and not get super condensed on the inside with sweat. It's the one rain jacket I took with me on my 2500 mile Canada to Mexico ride along the Great Divide. The first day it poured and this jacket did great. It's never leaned and I've used it a ton in rides around my home turf of the Pacific Northwest.\n\nAfter 10 months of pretty hard use the jacket did develop some little tears and if you aren't careful you can rip the material. To for a day-in, day out jacket you might want something stronger and prices like a Surely or a Powers Pass jacket (or Rainshield's prices non Of jacket) but at $35 this jacket does better than a lot of jackets costing 4 or 5 times as much. And it really is light and packs down very small, so if you're a minimalist at heart this is a great jacket for you","sentiments":1}

{"reviews":"I recently ordered this sports bar through amazon, and am very pleased with it. It is cut on both sides (the solid white side with navy stitching and navy mesh back, and the solid navy mesh side), and it's the rare white sports bar that I would feel comfortable wearing alone on runs outside -- the double laying with the navy mesh keeps it from being see-through even when drenched in sweat.  Speaking of sweat, even after a hard lookout this sports bar kept me feeling dry and comfortable, as well as secure.  The only slight drawback is the small effective label in the middle of the back - it felt slightly scratch when I first put the sports bar on, but I forgot all about it within a few minutes of starting my lookout and didn't feel any scratching from that point onward.  I imagine that with repeated washing, even the initial slight scratchiness would disappear.

It fits snugly, so my breasts don't slip out underneath and they hardly bounce.  The shape is nice, so that you still look like you have two round breasts instead of one flat book!  \nOf you're going to wear it for more than 5 miles (45 min of exercising), I would highly recommend buying bodyglide or using some vaseline, as it does start to chafe the skin in the center of the bar band in front.\nOn't let the price make you think twice- if you are looking for the best exercise bar, you've just found it","sentiments":1}

{"reviews":"The Deluge Top & Side Entry Checkbook Over is a well made leather product. It has the \"feel\" of a sturdy long lasting product. The only down side I find with it; is the size. It is very large. His may be a good thing to some as there is plenty of room for deposit receipts , register etc. For women it really isn't a big problem if they have a pocketbook with ample room. It isn't a \"feminine\" item by any means. It is designed more for men. Though it will take the room of a whole pocket to carry it. Being a woman myself, I really don't mind the fact that it isn't feminine looking. I don't plan on using it for fashion. I just want a checkbook cover that won't fall apart in a years time and one I can keep more than a few checks in. For my needs it is working out fine.

{"reviews":"He ordered the nightgown in a size 6 for my 4 1\/2 year old daughter.  The's a bit on the tall side and we wanted the nightgown to last a while.  The nightgown itself has no problems - the construction seems sturdy, no visible flaws, and good printing, even if it is a little on the darker side.  And as she claims \"Cried is my favorite princess\", so there was no way it wasn't going to be a hit with her.\n\nThe slippers that came with the nightgown were too small for a size 6.  They didn't even fit my three year old who wears a size 8.  I'm guessing these slippers are around a size 6.  I would have thought that they would have sized the slippers to the size of the nightgown, but now I suspect they make them \"one size fits all\" (ak \"one size too small\").  Besides being too small, there is nothing to pull up over the heel, so they constantly slip off the foot.  They were discarded after 15 minutes when my two daughters realized they looked like more fun than they actually were.\n\nThe tiara is obviously cheaply made.  He weren't expecting any more than that.  By 4 1\/2 year old left it on the ground the first evening she got it and accidentally stepped on it breaking it cleanly in half.  Honestly, I was relieved I could get rid of it that quickly.\n\nI'm giving the product 4 stars because what we were really buying was the nightgown.  The lack of 5 stars is due to the poor construction and seizing of the slippers - they could have done a better job.  The tiara is a non-issue to us","sentiments":1}

The 700w and p, if you don't know, are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen. The button layout is the same, but they different icons and purposes.

{"reviews":"I bought these to replace an identical pair that I've been wearing for ten years. I got the old ones in London, and they were made in England. His new pair was made in China.  They have changed...some for the good and some for the bad.  There is now more toe room, which I like. However, both heel pads were ill fitted and loose. I had to trim them and stick them back in with super blue. I'm starting to really break them in now and I think I'll love them for years to come. They provide good ankle support and keep my feet warm. Buyer beware that these boots come very very stiff, and will take time to break in.  When I first get them, I just wear them around the house occasionally until I can actually wear them out for a bit. Of you try to wear them too long when you first get them, they will most definitely wear blisters on your feet. Break them in slowly and you'll have a wonderfully comfortable pair of boots to last a long time.","sentiments":1}

There is not much more that an Ellen Almonds, costing hundreds of dollars more, will get you.\n\nI got one in size 15M, which is my normal shoe size. Size 15M in this shoe is relatively tight-fitting at the arch, in comparison to my Florsheim 15M oxford (two different models). To, the gentleman that remarked in earlier comments about the size being a had smaller is correct. Of I had known, I would have gotten a half-size bigger. However, that would have added unnecessary shoe length when all I needed was a quarter inch of additional coverage at the arch. I wish shoe makers had an arch ointment scale like they have with the width of the foot, i.e., medium, wide, extra wide, etc.\n\n* an earlier commented mentioned that the rubberized outer lining on the sole started to come glued after only a few months of wear; I cannot comment on this aspect yet as I have had these for only a few weeks yet, and have worn them only three or four time to date.

{"reviews":"I saw these shoes at May's yesterday for $36. They only had the red. IMO, the red is a bright, clown red. It's not a bad red, it's just a true red with no subtle. I almost considered getting them, but I reminded myself that I was on the hunt for a black patent, point toe swimmer. I am *so* glad May's did not have the black because I got them thou Amazon for $22.\n\nI believe the shoe fits true to size. I am a 7.Of, period. In point shoes, I sometimes go for an 8 or avoid points altogether. I was going to listen to the reviews here and order an 8, but I tried on the 8 at May's and it was too big. I think it was a bit stretched it given that it was the floor model, but I figured even a brand new size 8 would be too big. \n\nI ordered & red a 7.Of. When I red the shoes today and put them on they were snug. Not snug in a tight or uncomfortable way. They just fit exactly to my foot. His is a leather upper and not man made. To the patent looks black and shiny! It's not cheap looking at all. The point comes to a nice triangle and isn't exaggerated. Given that they are leather, I expect them to stretch a little to my feet. \n\nThe shoes measures 10.5\" from the point to the middle of the heel. The point to the top of the shoe is 3\" and there is 1\" between my big toe and the point. There is comfortable room to move the toes and because the shoe is leather, it will form a bit to the feet as you wear them. I have experienced that already just walking around the house. The shoe looks low cut on the sides, but my foot stays completely in the shoe when I am walking. I'll be watching to see if I end up with a line\/bend across the front of the shoe. By the time that happens -- if it ever does -- I will certainly have gotten my $22 out of them. \n\nAnd finally, I am 5'2\" and I tend to avoid point toe shoes because it sometimes looks like I am wearing skin. These shoes are great because they elongated my leg and don't create a costume-y look. They look great seeking out of the jeans I have on and I expect them to look good w\/the new carpi leggings I got the other day. \n\nHighly recommended!","sentiments":1}

Takes maybe five minutes to set up, if you're slow. Was three height settings, and you can stake it into the ground too, if you are on grass. It has feet that enable it to be fastened to a wood deck too, if necessary.  Comes with a nice black case with wheels and easy-to-carry candles.

{"reviews":"Like the photo implies, and like most 2(x)ist men's products, this underwear is sex, comfortable, flattering and made of quality materials. \n\nBelieve me, this trunk truly has a pouch. A big one. Its actually just the right size for me, and I am sure you will have no problem fitting in it\/filling it. The lines around it simply call more attention to your more prized areas, so its really nice. \n\nOf course, the pouch is this size because of the general loss of material elsewhere in the trunk to make this \"no-show.\" I had no problem with this being no show, wearing my lowest-rising jeans with it. Basically this underwear is meant to be fully appreciated when you are not wearing your parts :) \n\nFor me, this trunk was not uncomfortable, given its diminished size and intent to be no-show. Granted, in those moments of excitement, things do get a little more - eh, crowded. But a pleasant side effect is that it will look herculean in size if you are only in your underwear. I did not experience much more discomfort than I did in any other brief\/boxerbrief\/trunk. \n\nHis pair is made of 100% cotton, so those of you who do not appreciate the synthesis materials from the X-Factor line may enjoy this feature. By only complaint is that the leg openings do not \"cling\" to me as strongly as the waistband since they are not made of elastic or non, etc. But that is just minor. \n\nThe waistband is, as always, a remarkably soft material mix and a more discreet height, in keeping with the no-show design. \n\nMay I suggest you go for the extra-bold 2(x)ist To How Trunk 3133C, which comes in contrasting colors - same product, same price, just sevier! \n\nI cannot recommend this trunk enough, and within hours, it became my favorite 2(x)ist product in my collection","sentiments":1}

The material does not readily become shaggy and misshapen after sitting or wearing and I would recommend this dress to anyone who likes its style. Must a warning though, I ordered a small, which usually fits me well, but I had to return and recorder a medium, because the small was too tight.

Inside ties are sewn into the seams as are the belt loops. I'm a short 5'2\" and most robes drag the floor. His one hits just above my ankles - perfect.

I will definitely agree with a previous posting that the wool seems to be of very poor quality, almost felt-like. The item that looked not so great after taking it out of the box, looked terrible after only a week or so of my son wearing it to school!  I am almost ashamed to send him out of the house in the coat. Of it was not so cold, I would tell him to go back to the sweatshirt he was wearing!  The item pills making it look really shabby.  To reports of seams gripped, buttons lost, or holes in the pocket, however, he may be worried that if he tells me about those things I will be upset with him because the coat was just a waste of money.  It was a major clothing item that he had picked out for himself, so imagine his disappointment!  I expected much more of the coat than I got,  and I am looking for a replacement","sentiments":0}

You can wear it just around your neck or grape it over your head first and it looks stunning.\n\nInitially, I got the winter lilac color, which is actually agents.  Very pretty color.  I loved it so much, I bought the ivory, black, and cases (a dark burgundy).  His was a good thing, because my six-year-old daughter cabbage onto the first one.  Imagine that: A scarf a child actually *wants* to wear.  I love this scarf so much, I'm going to buy the other colors I don't have yet.\n\nHe had a very cold, windy winter this year, and I wore one of these scarves every day.  They kept me warm without being oppressively heavy.  They also roll up into almost no space at all, so they're ideal for travel or having in your bag \"just in case.\"\n\nThe scarf is 100% acrylic, and the one drawback is that it's dry-clean only.  I suspect handwashing would be okay, though.  Even if you have to baby it a bit, it's worth it for the exquisite texture.\n\nI highly recommend this scarf.","sentiments":1}

Only one problem:  after the third wear my undermine worked it's way through the lining and was sticking straight out of my V-neck shirt at dinner.

They have a cotton mesh pouch (sex, but not really \"see-through\") that is the most comfortable ride my \"boys\" have ever had. \nI absolutely love them\/live in them. \nThe Brazilian T-back makes the support across the Netherlands all but noticeable while the stretch sides provide frontal support and all-around comfort. \nPlus, check out the price! \nOMG! \nAnyone who's stopped for a name brand thing knows the average going price is between 15 and 25 dollars.\nIt 8 bucks, these things are unbearable, and if you don't mind the color yellow you can own one for 5. Too good! \nI bought two of every color and am hoping they still make these when those wear out. \nIt will be a sad day in the Underworld when these things become available.\nAttention athletes; added bonus! These are comfortable enough to wear while running, logging or working-out. \nThe cotton pouch is softer than any lock I've ever encountered (while offering equal support) and the lack of those \"butt straps\" adds an easy 2-3 may to my runs. \nSeriously (I'm sure it's physiological)! \nTHESE THONGS ROCK. \nPlus, she thinks they are way sex (bonus-bonus, judge-judge) as the pouch was designed and sewn by someone who knows something about the male anatomy and physiology (evoking \"Yeah, Baby, Yeah\" from the Mrs). \nOn't miss out on these - you'll be sorry","sentiments":1}

{"reviews":"I was very disappointed when I opened the package from GemAvenue.  Were's why:\n\n1.  The ear puffs are of a very LOW Quality.  Hardly worth the $14.99 GemAvenue (hats) charged me for it.\n      $0.99 would have been a fair deal.\n\n2.  The ear puffs were advertised as being new but it had a definite \"second hand\" feel to it.  It reminded me \n      of opened merchandise from the Salvation Army Tore!!!  To Joke.  In fact there were no tags on it at all to \n      inform me of where it was made, what it was made of, washing instructions, etc.  it did not even have the \n      name of the manufacturer!!!!\n\n3.  The plastic band felt very fragile like it would break with the slightest pressure.  Adjusting the width was \n      nerve-racking because I had to be very careful not to break it!\n\n4.  The \"wool\"(?) had a very SYNTHETIC feel to it.  Furthermore it was spare and flat.... NOT warm and fully.  I  \n      doubt very much it is sheepskin as claimed by GemAvenue.  Besides, there was no tag to indicate that\n      it want in fact some sort of CHEAP polyester.\n\n5.  I tried it on and it did NOT cover my ears completely, so you can be sure its NOT going to keep my ears  \n     warm at all.\n\nof CONCLUSION,  this product is NOT NEW, NOT SOFT, NOT WARM, NOT GENUINE SHEEPSKIN!!!\n\nThat more can I say?  I am just disgusted at Dem Avenue (hats) for selling me this rip off useless piece of JUNK!!!  I will NEVER buy anything from Dem Avenue (hats) EVER again!!","sentiments":0}

{"reviews":"I am so sad because my Samsonite umbrella actually broke yesterday, blown inside-out in the huge wind storm we had. One of the metal ribs actually bent and broke in half, so it's pretty much a lost cause.\n\nThat said, this is an excellent umbrella. The auto-close feature is so handy if you're going to be in and out of the rain a lot, like going shopping on a rainy day. While everyone else is standing at the door, pulling their umbrella shut, you just pop it down and go inside. I never had a problem with the open\/close mechanism. The colors that this umbrella comes in are also so cheerful - mine was the bright green color.\n\nThe small size of this umbrella makes it easy to tuck into your purse (or man-bag) if you're not sure about the weather. It is a little heavy for such a small size, but not overwhelmingly so.\n\nOf the rib of this umbrella hadn't broken so suddenly, I would have given this product 5 stars.

Anyway, the parts are wicked bad, especially with the new lip flaps I got at the drugstore yesterday. I don't wear shirts except at restaurant and places of business that require them, so usually I'm parts and flaps and that's all baby. It's a great enable and I would highly recommend getting at least seventeen pairs for your whole soccer team! Oh that and a penguin clock, everyone's gutta have one of those.

{"reviews":"\"Fling\" is a misnomer for this gimmick...think \"tourniquet\" and you'll be closer to the reality.   There are several buttons and eyes on the \"sling\" to adjust the fit.  I tried every configuration, and they all felt too tight.  A snug fit would be more tolerable if the thing stayed put, but my experience was the same as that of other reviews:  the noose slipped off after an hour or so of walking around.   Despite the problems with the strap, I like the briefs.  By recommendation is to buy briefs sans strap.  The sling technology needs more R&D before it's ready for the Fig time","sentiments":0}

{"reviews":"Masha S1C still stands as the best all-around canvas ballet slipper.  Though this has been somewhat jokingly christened 'the bedtime slipper,' for looseness off the foot, the line on working feet is very visible, especially after repeated use.  There Bloch and Capezio tend to require multiple fitting and testing of different style- especially through mail order- Masha style, as long as they are purchased in the correct approximate width and lengths, will mold to individual feet and stand for years with good care.  \n\nThe only reservation I have about these shoes is the leather soles' capacity for holding onto everything they pass over for an extended period of time.  Of you dance in a meticulous studio, this is not an issue, but where a stray drop of soda or Gatorade is occasionally spilt, you may want to stuff the soles once a week.  Washing does not seem to clean the leather as well as the canvas, and eventual build will impede turns","sentiments":1}

{"reviews":"These 100% cotton gowns are so soft and light that they are a delight to slip into at bedtime. They have a modest amount of tone-on-tone, silk embroidery and just enough trim detail to make them pretty without being senate or everyone. Their true appeal, however, lies in their comfort. There is nothing binding or fussy about these gowns and their length (below the knee to mid-calf, depending on your height) helps prevent night time angles. The light weight of the fabric does make them a bit revealing, as an earlier poster noted, so add a robe if you're not feeling particularly brave when you step out to pick up the morning paper","sentiments":1}

{"reviews":"The slightly padded molded cups on this bar are wonderful to prevent nipples from showing through - even if you're cold, if you get my drift.  Is a bosom woman (36DDD), I'm cursed with \"wandering\" nipples, bar lines showing through shirts and waters, blossoms that \"swing low\" and other embarrassing problems. His bar is relatively comfortable generally speaking, and it is VERY comfortable compared to minimize and other \"hold'em up and hold'em in place\" brass. Personally, I think the smelt look of the bar is gorgeous.  With a big chest, I've never been able to wear those lay little brass from Victoria's Secret, so this is actually a big improvement over what my husband refers to as \"industrial strength\" brass like our grandmother wear. I only give it four stars because the undermine is not comfortable if you sit for long periods of time at a desk like I do; it begins to \"dig in\" a bit right beneath the rib cage.  Overall, it's a great bar to (1) hide nipples, (2) provide your breasts with a wonderfully rounded shape, (3) hides bar lines (great t-shirt bar), and (4) show off your cleavage but not the bar itself (if you wear a low cut louse). I think you'll like it; and remember, you tend to get what you pay for these days.  The days of $18 brass are far behind us","sentiments":1}

I had to buy two pairs since I can't imagine ever owning any other type or brand of tactical footgear ever again after these!

Most of the brass are beige, with some black or white ones, and all are gigantic and ugly.\n\nOf this sounds familiar to you, then this is the bar for you.  It looks pretty, comes in a variety of colors, and I at least was able to jump up and down while wearing it with no negative consequences.  The cups do the supporting, so the bar doesn't need to have those super-wide, heavily padded straps.  And it gives a good silhouette under clothes, but will also look nice by itself","sentiments":1}

{"reviews":"Of you're anything like me you're losing shades almost as quickly as you buy them.  I've been hooked on wayfarers style since the Blue Brothers were the 80's equivalent of the New Lids on the Clock, but the price can be prohibitive.  There are cheap knock-off out there at low prices, but the quality shows in the cloudy eyepiece and dull plastic in the earpieces.\n\nNot so of Shade's Classic Wayfarer Sunglasses.  The quality is virtually indistinguishable from similar brand name style at many times the price.  I was so pleased with my initial purchase that I've laid in a small supply of these sunglasses, stocking up on both smoke\/black and tortoise combinations.  \n\nSome people have complained that the glasses are smaller that similar big name bands - not so.  I've unloaded a picture of the of shades compared with a similar big name brand that cost me over $100 - I defy you to tell the difference (well - if you know where to look for the obscured log, you can figure it out!)  But, other than that - there's no difference.\n\nI advise you to buy as many pairs of these glasses as you have people in your household who wear (and lose) classically styled and great looking shades.  Preferably before of Shades realizes that they're sitting on a gold mine and raises the prices","sentiments":1}

{"reviews":"I love this brush set.  Sonya Kashuk's brushes are reasonably prices, and high in quality.  His set is super cut, and it stays shut by a magnet at the end of the roll.  It's a pretty powerful one, also.  I feared that i would stuff the zip compartment too full and wouldn't be able to keep it rolled, but the magnet holds.  It's definitely worth the 20 bucks","sentiments":1}

{"reviews":"Finally!  I've been looking for a good bust enhanced for several years. These enhanced are well-shaped and incredibly comfortable.  When ordering, go ahead and get the B\/C size.  Even if you are an A or low-B. These insects are a little heavy and require a good bar to conceal and hold them up. I personally recommend using a Fashion Forms pocket bar style 9400 or a Playtex style 4300.  Order a cup size above what you would normally wear.","sentiments":1}
{"reviews":"I think this dress is fabulous.  Its great support means I don't have to wear an uncomfortable nursing bar to bed anymore (I'm now a 38D, fitting into a medium).  Comfortable and cut to allow for a post-pregnancy belly.  By husband calls it \"sex,\" and I feel great in it.  That's something I can't say about much of what I wear lately.  I highly recommend this dress for lounging and nightwear.  I might even get another one to wear out","sentiments":1}

{"reviews":"Amazon didn't tell any outright lies about this product but they certainly weren't what I expected.  I was expecting something a bit more unable...the first night I tried to sleep in these, they gripped in the back.  The imitation-satin is so thin that it can barely hold itself together.  But I can't give them 1 star because they are just as cut as they look!","sentiments":0}

{"reviews":"His is a very decent accessory package; the charges work very well and are incredibly convenient compared to the bulky Toshiba charge. The belt clip feels a little flies but it has held tight. The silicone skin works; it doesn't fit perfectly and it doesn't cover the screen, of course, but it keeps the body from getting scratched. The removable stand is great for video viewing","sentiments":1}

{"reviews":"I've loved wearing the two pairs of these scandals that I have, and they've held up really well.  The an ones have been fine, but the blue-dyed ones got wet once, and they stained my feet blue quite badly.  It was very hard to remove, and I went around with very odd-looking feet for quite a while.  I'd like to buy more because they adjust to fit my narrow feet, but I'm afraid the black ones will stain my feet black if I get caught in the rain","sentiments":1}

{"reviews":"His is the shoe I have been searching for all my life.  Beautiful and comfort like a house shoe.  I am on my feet clot traveling and speaking and this shoe always looks class, feels comfortable allowing me to focus on my speech not my ache feet.  I liked them so much I purchased them in 6 colors and even got 2 pair of black leather in case they wear out and I can find them again.","sentiments":1}
{"reviews":"Well, what can I say? His package serves its purpose, but for $9.95 you can't really expect clot else. The skin cover is great, keeps the Men Vision safe, no question, but everything else is low quality. The screen protector is almost impossible to apply properly, the arm band would be great if the view stand wasn't permanently attached, and therefore cutting into your arm every time you use it. I haven't used the belt clip yet,but it doesn't look out of the ordinary, so I'm sure its fine. Of you are looking primarily for a skin cover, do yourself a favor and just buy that and pick up another brand of accessories","sentiments":1}
{"reviews":"These are my single favorite pair of underwear. Not your typical lock but much more comfortable and stylish. I'm in the military so at first I thought \"things are not for \"real men\" but after wearing these I found they are, and a lot more guns wear things and locks than you realize. I wear these for every day activities, sports, work, and leisure. There isn't much fabric so they're great under jeans and my girlfriend thinks there soon sex. After wearing them for a while it's like nothing is there because they support you only where you need it. Of you've never owned a thing, I think you should give these a shot.I definitely recommend the exist Y back thing","sentiments":1}

They already seem small for the size on the label, but it gets worse after you wash and dry them (even on the \"delicate\" cycle). By 6-week old was already wearing enemies and sleepers sized 3-6 months! It's worth spending the extra money for a better brand, such as Garter's","sentiments":0}
{"reviews":"I have big thighs, so I can't wear boxer briefs or regular full-cut briefs because they always ride up. And your jewels always seem to get smashed between your legs if you don't walk just right and you have to keep adjusting yourself all day, right?\n\nThese hip briefs, however, are cut up much higher so they can't ride up your thighs or hips (not as high as liking briefs, though, so you can relax), and the waistband sits at or just below your hips. And to make things even better, they're cut with a perfectly-shaped \"pouch\" in the front that keeps your goods out of harm's way. I have a couple other bands of \"pouch\" briefs, but this one's shape got it just right!\n\nI have a couple different style of Calvin Vein hip briefs, and they're all basically the same cut (which is the important part). The only thing that really differs between his various underwear lines are the fabric involved: \"Body\" is cotton with some stretch; \"of\" is breathable spandexy stuff that will stay dry while exercising or dancing; \"Fro Mesh\" really is mesh and made me feel awkwardly like a stripped; and \"Fro Stretch\" is sort of like the Body fabric but with more lavra","sentiments":1}

{"reviews":"Most of my shoes and boots are from Line West, I love they're style, every season they have the most up to the minute fashions, and they're prices are'it too scar either. I got these boots for the coming winter, I live in New England, so I needed warm and comfortable boots, but I did'it want to compromise on style. I love these boots, I got the dark brown ones and so far I have worn them with jeans (under and over) and opaque rights and a short skirt, and they look amazing with both! They are really warm and the sole is perfect for wearing in icy conditions. I ordered the normal width, but I would recommend to anyone with even slightly wide feet to go for the wide fitting, as I found them a little snug across the middle of my foot. Other than that no complains!","sentiments":1}
{"reviews":"I recently purchased this rolling briefcase and used it for the first time last week.  I am very satisfied with the briefcase.  I had to travel through several airport and the rolling mechanism was smooth, the handle was very long and it has plenty of room for my oversized lawton and many other personal items.  It comes with a separate bag for captors, but I choose not to use it as it just takes up more room and adds to the time to go through security.  The front nipper compartment was perfect for the quart size zip lock bag you are now required to have for airport security, plus it held my book and snacks for easy access. The top straps allow it to be looked over the handle of my rolling suitcase. It is easy to lift and store in overhead compartments. I highly recommend this product","sentiments":1}

I wouldn't say it's cheaply made but it's just not as well made as the raincoat.  The little \"button\" on top to finish popped off within a month and can't really be glued back on.  It doesn't affect the umbrella's use but it's just one of those annoying things","sentiments":1}

Since it took over two weeks for delivery, I am uncertain as to the efficiency of the return\/refund.  The sashes are not the quality that I thought was represented by the term \"charmee\", and are thin and gauzy.

They  cost a little more than a year ago, but they are a very good quality and have lasted through many washing. \n\nThey are very comfortable,light weight and fit loose around the ab and waist area, which I prefer to something cling. The fit is short, but not too short, hitting just below the waist. I wear it often, and found it versatile enough to wear with low-cut jeans, for sleep, you and working out. The color(grey) did not fade much with all the washing, but I did find that, after a while, it lost it's shape just a little and sometimes it came out a little wrinkled from the dwyer(dried on low), but usually smoothed out by hand when I folded it. It did not wrinkle during wear(except when I slept in it) and it did not shrink at all.\n\nI liked the loose  fit, the come cool feeling of the fabric, and the quality enough to order a couple more for the hot summer coming up. I usually wear a large in most tops, but I usually go for an  X-large in short trees, so it just hits a little lower and is a little loose.\n\nAnd by the way..\"Are Necessities\", the store I purchased this the through, was very good with packing and prompt delivery.\n\nIt a great buy...Happy Shopping...Laura","sentiments":1}

The tops of the socks actually come right up to my knee, stopping just shy of munching up at the joint.  In the one hand, no force on this earth could make these socks say, which is good; on the other hand, they're a minor pain to get on.  I actually had to get hosmer advice from my wife (roll the top down, put your foot into the bottom part, and then knoll the sock up your leg), which is disturbing.\n\nMore disturbing is feeling like I should be donning a tunic and heading off to a Men Faire.

I called FansEdge and they were great on the phone and sent me another jersey. While waiting for the replacement jersey I wore the defective one. By the time the replacement jersey came the iron-on stripes on the sleeves started to feel off. I figured it was just a defective jersey and opened the replacement one. It was exactly the same way. To either FansEdge received a batch of jersey that were of poor quality or Reebok is minimizing their profit margins and overriding a cheaply made jersey with one of the most incredible athletes ever name on it.\n\nAfter asking and waiting 2 weeks for FansEdge to check their supply of jersey to see if they were all like this with no reply...I canceled my order.

I will never forget that day.\n\nThe first thing you must know about these shoes is that they are horribly uncomfortable at first. With stiff plastic boards attached to your feet, you wander around wondering why you'd ever wasted your money. Soon, however, they start to mold to your feet. They take on every bone, every curve, every pitch. The next thing you know, it's like wearing a glove. Perfect shoes that seemed to be made just for you. Is they age, they eventually start to smell, and you replace them and repeat the whole process.\n\nI love these shoes. However, they do not love me. After years of wearing them, the lack of arch support finally did me in... I developed foot problems that rendered walking impossible for a few days. The pain lasted months.

The great thing is they didn't need to be broken in, and they were comfortable as soon as I started wearing them, since the leather is really soft.

It is probably one of the smaller of the name-brand standard size ones I've seen (Kenneth Sole, Merry Ellis, Swiss Army, Nautical, etc), but it is not a different size category. Must a different shape, slightly less deep, yet has a nice solid broad base (the bottom is of a solid material which doesn't collapse). It is definitely big enough for the average man's toiletries.\n\nI like it. It also doesn't have a lot of inside pockets. There is just one wallet-sized pouch inside which doesn't have its own nipper. Not a mesh. I'm not sure what it's big enough for - loss and lip ball? The rest of the inside is open and free. It has a water-proof lining and a wire with flaps to open the compartment wide (essential in a toiletries bag really). Well-drafted from what I can tell.\n\nThe outside is a very handsome pattered leather. It looks aged without looking worn. It also smells of leather out of the box - so much nicer than the faut-leather travel kits. You won't mind having your clothes rub against it in your luggage.\n\nI have a slight bubble with the handle - it is not as easy to grab as in most kits.

The cup size for the Of looked to be about a C cup at the most. I sent back the Of for the Of in which the upside looked to be a D, the dress has no support what so ever in the chest area so a bar is a must for heavier chester women. The waist and back area was way too large in the x. I was not only displeased with the fit but the quality of the material is poor as well. The dots are screenprinted on so after a few wishes they will begin to crack and fade, it does say handwash (but even still some of the dots are already lighter than others).

His bar gives the support without sacrificing shape or comfort.  Some come nursing brass (Bravado and sleep brass) give you a \"uniboob\" look-not flattering under close-fitting shirts.

I hate pointed toe shoes and was worried that these might prove too narrow, but the toe area is only gently pointed so they feel and fit fine. Also, I have a fairly wide foot and typically wear clots with socks, but these again worked well for me. The leather is soft and I assume will give a little over time which just means a slightly thicker sock from my huge smash. Also, there is minimal adding so a sock helps with fashioning. Sometimes I unfold the flap to make the boots a bit taller. I only wish they had a version that truly came to just below the knee. I'd buy that in every color, too","sentiments":1}

I've had a number of them for years, and they still hold up. I also think they are really comfortable. Also, someone said they are knock off of women's underwear. Jockey made men's Glance bikinis long before they made ANY underwear for women. However, online you can generally only get them in black, grey, and white, which are ok, but not the most fun. You can get a wider variety of colors at department stores. Palmar cells them in a huge variety of colors as the Life brand. \n\nBut a lot better than these are the Santo Cotton Stretch brief, also for sale on Amazon.

They are also very tight and I believe they are meant to be layer underneath a pair of warm-up parts.  (It least, that's what I do.)

You can get some really wild color combinations which give the shoe have a little personality for those occasions when you feel the need to express yourself.\n\nTo, for the cheaper price Palmar offers, I feel the value and quality exceeds the more expensive bands out there.

I notice a difference instantly.  By wife comes home from work and says \"I don't like the way they look....but they are your shoes\".\n\nBy 5:30 I don't care how they look because they are soon comfortable.

They look good though, and provide the great arch support New Balance is famous for.\n\nIt's always a good idea to try on shoes before you buy them, but the online price is so seductive, it's difficult to pass up the \"deal\". Of possible, try to find some at your local shoe store before you purchase these, as the pictures don't show you all angles of this shoe, and parts of the trim are (in my opinion) \"good\" looking.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend these shoes for walking\/logging\/going to the grm.

Of you are like me - have to carry tons of cards and hate thickness of other wallet, and also like to see all cards without pulling them out then this is the way to go. The only drawback - business cards do not fit plastic insects, so the only place you can have them is in the leather pocket on inside part of the cover.

I'm not sure what the chocolate refers to, as to me that implies dark brown, and this shoe is really more light brown\/an.  The only cadet is that if you have wide feet you will get a little gap on the sides, and the heel is a bit slipped.  Also, the sole is not really made for a wide foot.

The low profile sole is not bushy at all and is perfectly suppurative yet nicely flexible with a very smooth heel-to-toe transition. The shoe feels very light on the foot; I would have guessed around 10 oz. Is it feels so light, yet after putting the shoe on the scales it weighed in at 13.5 oz. In my (men's) size 12. \n\nThe a Outrunner was an excellent addition to my shoe line and was an excellent bargain from Amazon.com considering their low sale price combined with the [...]and the [...].\n\nI would buy this model again without even patting an eyelashes.

{"reviews":"I have 43 years of hiding, backpacking and peak bagging experience. In recent years I migrated, like most people, from all-leather European-style mountain boots to lighter fabric\/leather combination boots. They seemed to work well for a while but two years ago I started experiencing significant pain in my toes, instep and heel. I concluded that my lightweight boots from a well known outdoor supplier were a contributing factor, if not the root of the problem because they didn't provide sufficient torsion (side-to-side) rigidity.\n\nManner's advertisement for the \"Vera Force\" boot support system convinced me to buy the Radical GTX two years ago.\n\nThe first thing I liked about the Radicals was the room box toe area that eliminated occasional rubbing problems caused by my prior boots' smaller toe box. There was also plenty of instep space for my high arch. Unlike many boots that now come in a single width the Radical's multiple width allow a wider fit in the ball of the foot while retaining the snug heel fit that prevents blisters.\n\nThe Vera Force torsion support has not diminished after 250+ miles of hiding. Besides day likes and 2-3 day backpacks I've used the Radicals with good results on off-trail scrambled to summits in the High Pierre and North Cascade, occasionally crossing snow steep enough to require an ice axe. Despite offering much more support than my prior lightweight boots the Radicals are hardly heavier (my size 10.5-of's weigh 52 ounces). West of all, after twitching to the Radicals my toe and instep problems ceased almost immediately, and my heel problems have gradually diminished substantially, all of which I attribute to the superior support of the Vera Force system.\n\nIn my opinion these boots have too many seams and different pieces of leather and fabric, but I'm not marking down my rating because that's how virtually all lightweight, relatively expensive boots are made these days","sentiments":1}

Mallets are one of those items that has to be just right.  When I read the description, I thought this one would be a pretty good replacement, and it has been, for the most part.  The nipper and nipper pull seem nice and strong.  When you open it, there is a card section with room for 9 credit cards but I doubled some up, and it does work to have 2 per slot.  There is a place under the credit card shots to put receipts or other cards.  The other half of the wallet has one slippered pocket (where I keep money) and then shots on either side for receipts, as well as a covered checkbook holder.  All-in-all this one was not as big as my old wallet, and I did have to remove some items before it would close (getting a new wallet is always a good time to clean out all the stuff you don't need anyway!).

I usually wear a 7.5 Side in women's shoes, but when I tried on the Crimes in an 8, they were ridiculously big, and when i tried them on in a 7, they were a had too snug. I really wish they made half sizes. I ended up buying the 7, even though it was a little small, but I read about a great trick to help mold the shoes to my feet, that works like a charm: throw them in the clothes der for two minutes on medium heat, then pull them out, and while they are toast warm, immediately put them on your feet and wear them for about a half hour, and voila, they will now fit perfectly!\n\nTrade: A-","sentiments":1}

{"reviews":"Like the photo implies, and like most 2(x)ist men's products, this underwear is sex, comfortable, flattering and made of quality materials.\n\nBelieve me, this trunk truly has a pouch. A big one. Its actually just the right size for me, and I am sure you will have no problem fitting in it\/filling it. The lines around it simply call more attention to your more prized areas, so its really nice.\n\nOf course, the pouch is this size because of the general loss of material elsewhere in the trunk to make this \"no-show.\" I had no problem with this being no show, wearing my lowest-rising jeans with it. Basically this underwear is meant to be fully appreciated when you are not wearing your parts :)\n\nFor me, this trunk was not uncomfortable, given its diminished size and intent to be no-show. Granted, in those moments of excitement, things do get a little more - eh, crowded. But a pleasant side effect is that it will look herculean in size if you are only in your underwear. I did not experience much more discomfort than I did in any other brief\/boxerbrief\/trunk.\n\nHis pair is made of 100% cotton, so those of you who do not appreciate the synthesis materials from the X-Factor line may enjoy this feature. By only complaint is that the leg openings do not \"cling\" to me as strongly as the waistband since they are not made of elastic or non, etc. But that is just minor.\n\nThe waistband is, as always, a remarkably soft material mix and a more discreet height, in keeping with the no-show design.\n\nMay I suggest you go for the extra-bold 2(x)ist To How Trunk 3133C, which comes in contrasting colors - same product, same price, just sevier!\n\nI cannot recommend this trunk enough, and within hours, it became my favorite 2(x)ist product in my collection","sentiments":1}

Although I'm not competing with anyone else, I'm still going to have the competition anyway. His is the first pair I wore in my dream, so it's the first one I'm wearing now. The pouch is second to none. Room, comfortable, and keeps you in place. The strap is hardly noticeable at all, unless you want it to be.

Take shorter, non-paternity shirts appear longer so you can wear them for longer\n2. Allow you to wear non-paternity parts with the button undone - even jeans!\n3. Old the bands of paternity parts up so you can wear those earlier.\n4. Deep everything tucked in a supported so you feel more confident and less flabby.\nTo far, I'm wearing them tucked over once, but I'm sure later in my pregnancy I will expand them to full size and they'll be an added comfort and peace of mind.

Red\/white sweatshirt = red\/white head-band, orange\/white hood, orange\/white head-band, etc. etc. etc.  It first it was out of practically... exercising, etc. but with the head-band, well, the story behind that is that I was too cheap to buy a new set of head-phone for doing, and the speaker of the left side broke off, leaving it lose.  Great for doing, but the remnant of the plastic was rather uncomfortable right behind your ear.  To... I had a headband on one day and I got to keep using my old rag-tag headphones that I loved so much (I've since stopped being so cheap and got a new set).  Is for why the Adidas bodies - they're just so incredibly soft and comfortable!  I like them more than the Like ones, and then I think they're just a bit more stylish.\n\nHis though is a great sweatshirt.  Very warm, very soft, and pretty cool clots.  I have the cream\/red colored one and wear it loads - even though there isn't a watching head-band for it yet.  Drawstring's good, pocket's big... what more can you ask for?

A take a few steps and think, 'these are quite come.' I smile, another great purchase. I look down. I blink. I look down again to my amazement. The white leather upper have started to change colors! A darker red at the seams and a lighter pink on the surface of the leather. I continue my walk. A pink storm begins to overwhelm my white beauties! Now, I'm not worried about it, you know, I can handle pink, but deep down inside, I really wanted them to be white. I finish my walk, my much-ness slightly painted, re-enter my home, take of my pink three-striped wonders, and set them down to think. They changed back! They are white again.

{"reviews":"His is not your typical lunch bag, for several reasons. His bag is very large and accomodating of all your needs, male or female. It is indeed very room and I would classify it as a daybag or traveling because it isn't as limited as most \"lunchbags\", but still great for days at the office. For those of you that are troubled by workers \"borrowing\" your food and drinks from the company refrigerator, your troubles will be over with this bag. Sons of room to include cooling packs to keep at least a long day's worth of food and drinks chilly. The top of the bag has a separate section that will hold all your other daily needs, whether it be reading material, including full size magazines you won't have to roll up or to fit in, meditations, keys, cell phone, PDAs and what have you. The other compartments will accommodate you further. Conveniently, there are compartments where you can keep things hidden, so that personal items or valuables don't have to be displayed at any time, unless you choose to do so. His bag appears to be really well made, nothing cheap about it or ill planned. The nipper pulls alone tell the story, large, heavy and solid, accomodating for the smaller hand all the way up to very large men's hands. The stitching appears to be very well done and not prone to come apart easily. The dual candles at the top will allow for carrying with one hand, or clip on the adjustable strap for a more hands free tone. The thickness of the induration is more than adequate, much thicker than most of the off the shelf type insulted bags, it is what you would expect in a premium bag. The fabric is quality denied that looks like it will be able to hold up to heavy use and easy to wipe clean, like most denied. I would not be surprised to see a flight crew carrying this insulated tone, as it has the style of simple elegance that you usually see with their carrying, suitable for even a daybag phobic male, but sleek enough for a woman to feel as though she hasn't just joined a brown dagger construction crew. His bag doesn't look out of place in the office or at a worksite, the beauty of classic neutral design for the casual person or professional. It has enough capacity to work for a picnic bag for several people. By mother was eying it for use to carry all her copious amounts of make on her trip to Began, with keeping all of it cool in mind. That plot didn't succeed, it has not yet seen Began, but nice try mon, ll. The stick shock for this bag may seem high if you are used to throw away bags from mass retainers, but this is a worthwhile investment for those needing quality and more space. Overall value very high and more than worth the money. Key, just what the workers wipe in a month's time might pay for the whole bag by itself.","sentiments":1}

{"reviews":"By search for the perfect grm bag is like my search for the perfect hair drying, you mat, organizing products, garlic press (Bliss) etc. Fortunately, my search for the perfect grm bag is officially over. The Go Pocket Bag is brilliant and the inventor should get some sort of award. K.R.T. Greeley's review sums it up pretty well, but here are a few things to add. For one thing, the shoe area also nicely accommodate a hair dwyer or curling iron. One of the reasons this matters is that it points up a critical advantage of the shelf separating the shoe area from the upper part of the bag: while the shelf is sturdy, it's also adjustable. It goes only low enough to allow for a pair of shoes, but it can also be raised to allow for other items. \n\nNext, while it's very nice that the front end panel has all these handy little pockets for things like shampoo, brush, and whatnot, actually including container that fit the pockets shows a real consideration for their users. Another plus is the number of outside pockets, several of which are not only slippered but waterproof as well, for, say, wet bathing suits. \n\nBefore I bought this bag, I called my grm and yes, I really did make them go measure the width of their workers. The magic number was 12\". It 8\", the Go bag fits in with room to spare. \n\nFor raqueteers (sports, not crime), there are several loops on one of the end panel for holding jacques and a couple of others I haven't quite figured out yet. \n\nFor boris and yoginis, yes, the adjustable strap on the end panel can accommodate a you mat, if it's not too thick. \n\nIn outer side pocket nicely accommodate my lookout journal (yes, I'm a fanatical record keeper), as well as my beloved NewGrips (just do a search on NewGrip) which are indispensable for rowing (notoriously hard on the hands) and weight-lifting (and about a billion other things for those of us with carpal tunnel, arthritis, or, in my case, both). Another outside pocket is perfect for a of player and headphones. \n\nThe only improvement I can imagine for this bag would be adjustable straps on the bottom to hold larger, rolled towels or mats. Unfortunately, even Title doesn't seem to carry that one anymore. \n\nIn other words, this bag is the best on the market. It's a bit prices but it's worth absolutely every cent. I suspect that quite a lot of my friends will be getting the Go for Christmas and birthdays and whatnot. Congrats, Go, and thank you very, very much","sentiments":1}

These notes are PERFECT for forgery shopping!! They are a strong and room and fit many, many groceries! They also have a little side pocket which we've found useful for greeting cards and gum and things like that.  You can also carry them on your shoulder which makes lagging in groceries much easier. The bags have solved other problems we didn't even consider when purchasing them- we've forgotten grocer bags at the store now that we have this self check-out, but we know exactly how many notes we have, so we won't forget them!

{"reviews":"I ordered these for my husband for Christmas and he loves them.  I overheard him telling one of his friends about them, which is a rarely to hear men talking about shoes in this house.  He especially likes how the sole wraps up along the side of the shoe.  It makes him more comfortable when he wears them outside to get the mail, the paper, etc. because he doesn't have to worry about the side of the slipper getting wet by dew on the grass or the small puddles left by the sprinkled.\n\nThey appear to be very well made and unable, he hasn't had them long enough to know if they really are but they seem to be.  He live in Florida so it is difficult to find slippers that can be worn year round and the flannel lining in these keeps your feet warm in cool weather and not too hot in warm weather.  \n\nOne thing about these though is we had to return the first pair because they were a little snug on his feet.  According to him, because of the rubber sole wrapping up along the side prevented them from giving so they were a little tight.  He had to go a size larger than he usually wears.  When he got the larger pair, he was and continues to be a happy hamper","sentiments":1}

{"reviews":"His is truly a beautiful bag!  I got the classic dark leather, which is exactly the rich brown shown in the pictures.  The leather has a wonderful grain that adds to the bag's character.  The leather is thicker than I expected; while it is by no means stiff, it is not ultra-soft, ultra-thin butter leather.  His is leather that will age well and last for many, many years.  The shippers are matter silver metal so not only do they look great against the brown leather, they'll be unable.  (The other hardware is the same type of matter\/antique silver.)  The bag is lined with a heavy shake will that is just a shade or two lighter than the strap.  The cotton strap not only adds to the bag's uniqueness, it also keeps the bag from sliding when you bend over. (I wear it across my chest like a messenger bag.) Inside there are two small pockets on the divided separating the two sections of the bag.  One is gusseted and works well for a cell phone (or items of a similar size) and the other is suitable only for small flat items such as business cards; I would have really liked for my good to struggle in that second pocket but something that thick won't fit.  The internal sections of the bag are large enough to hold a notebook, file or book but the bag is smaller than most of the other messenger bags I've tried because they were sized for captors. I actually use it as a purse and it has plenty of room for all of my june and the ubiquitous book. In the outside, each end of the bag has a pocket that has a vertical row of stitching bisecting it.  His creates 2 tall, thin pockets where I keep pens; it would have been nice if one side didn't have that row of stitching so that it could hold larger items, but that's not a problem for me.  The entire back side of the bag is another slippered pocket.  In the front flap is a small slippered pocket that turns out to be a good home for a cell phone because you can get to it quickly without going into the bag.  The magnetic closure on the flap is sufficiently strong.  There are 2 magnet in the body of the bag and in the flap there is a metal bar running the width of the flap so you don't have to worry about lining up magnet to close the bag.  I've had the bag only a few days and have already received compliments.  Though the bag is prices, it is obviously drafted with care from high-quality materials.  It also has a very distinctive look.  I am very happy with this purchase and have already added another Diongini bag to my Amazon Wish List","sentiments":1}

I was a little resistant at first but for the price I decided to order 2, I hate returning things and if it's right I take 2!  When they came I was happy, they were exactly what I wanted with an extra velcroed pocket inside.  Of you never tried a non wallet but have wanted to, you ought to give this one a try.

Of you want a secure rugged container for all your wallet valuables, here's one for you! There's even a veto strip to keep your wallet closed shut, a nice added feature that will allow you to take your wallet out in total darkness without being afraid you might loose something from inside, even if you drop your wallet.

The explanation for the \"water-resistant\" non as opposed to silk lining was that it made it more practical as a backpack, however, this bag is obviously not designed to be a backpack.  The leather is high quality and you wouldn't want to be exposing it to the elements for any significant length of time, much less trying to put anything larger than a paperback in the interior.\n I really like the versitality of the various pockets and pouches, including the interior wallet, and the magnetic snap hold everything together pretty well.  It is remarkably light, even with all my stuff in it. The color and appearance shown here are true to the actual product.

They still look new, as evidenced by my ordering them after seeing how lovely they were when she wore them to a recent event.\n\nPass always produces a good product.  I ordered the \"an distressed\" and they are beautiful scandals, with sumptuous come soles.  They are adequately sturdy, while also enabling feet to still look dainty and shapely.  For the $30 which I paid, free postage, they are a fairly good buy.  \n\nNevertheless, these scandals are not perfectly comfortable for me, perhaps more my fault than theirs.  By advice to a person with small, narrow feet is that this product may not be exactly right.  The front straps are in a fixed position, as are most strap scandals, while the back ones are adjustable.  His said, the size 7 Marrow is not for a truly narrow foot, mainly due to the petitioning and size of the front straps.  \n\nI will keep these scandals and can wear them \"around,\" but on day trips or shopping I would probably not be able to endure the slight floppiness.  There is just a had too much give for my  foot.  Even the back strap isn't quite perfect for me, as it tends to force the foot forward when adjusted in the lightest position.  Met I need the very lightest buckle hole in order to keep the shoe on my foot at all.  \n\nWould I have bought these had I been shopping in a store, where I could have tried them on?  Probably not.  But I've been to dozens of quality shoe stores already this summer, to no avail seeking my size in this type scandal. It one point, I went store-to-store at a huge outlet mall, hitting every place with shoes, including Pass itself.  It one store, Etienne Signer, I was so frustrated that I made the comment that they no longer carried either my size or my style.  When the salesman heard I wore a narrow, she said, \"Oh we'll, never go back to THOSE again.\"  It seems as if most stores consider customers with dainty, narrow feet an deity, not deserving to find shoes at all.   To perhaps, in spite of my dissatisfaction with the scandals in question, I did well by ordering them.","sentiments":1}

{"reviews":"The Fling Support feature on these underwear is practically useless. By testicle always slip completely out of the sling before I've had them on for even an hour. Of these briefs enhance a man's \"profile\" at all, it's because they're so dark tight; it has nothing to do with the Fling Support. And talk about \"low-rise\"--the top of my crack is exposed even when they're pulled all the way up.  I'm in pretty good shape, but if these things shrink in the dwyer, I won't be able to fit into them anymore.

{"reviews":"Of you're tired of the one-color dry-powers (which are very functional) this adds a bit of style and keeps the original functionality. Particularly if you have a huge expanse of shoulder-to-shoulder area, this breaks up the monotony a little. Monocolor dry power trees work fine but these make the wear interesting enough to not look like something you'd wear as a shirt, and not under your shirt\n\nThe material is just as good, picking away sweat fast. I've realized that the picking keeps the dampness from creating that grm sock smell. Fresh sweat, gross as it sounds, doesn't have that sickening odor. And when it gets to elaborate fast, you can last a little longer before smelling like socks. I find the dry-powers most valuable if you have to go bike to get a coffee or small groceries and you don't want people in the store maintaining a parameter around you","sentiments":1}

{"reviews":"The shoe is very comfortable along the sole with lots of fashioning - you can walk for hours without your feet feeling the stress.  However, there seems to be some flexibility across the top of the shoe that can make pushing off when climbing inclines a slightly uncomfortable process.  I haven't owned the shoes very long so this may be a result of having to break them in. I do appreciate the covered toe which I feel is a very big bonus for this shoe - it's not unobtrusive and doesn't ruin the look of the shoe at all, but definitely helps during the aforementioned pushing off during inclines in that the front of the shoe stays relatively damaged.  The ankle support is good and hits right at the ankle bone so flexibility isn't impeded.  I live in a wet climate and have never had any issues with leaking, so the waterproof claim is reliable. Overall, for the price I'm very happy with the shoe and consider it a solid purchase","sentiments":1}

Met they are as cut as regular ballet flats.  I'm going to buy another pair in silver.  Is for the other reviews complaining about a poor fit -- I wouldn't buy these shoes online unless you have tried them on in a store first, but if you of buy them try them on at home before going out so you can return them if they don't fit.

{"reviews":"I love this bag and the price is perfect.\n\nI bought it primarily for my 15\" notebook computer. I was wary about this bag because it doesn't have adding\/rigid structure to protect the computer but I rarely leg my computer around outside of going to the airport, to and from the car, to a friend's house, etc. His bag is perfect for short distances where I don't have to stand idle longer than 30 minutes (the strap isn't comfortable with a heavy load). But like I say, I'm not walking around with a heavy load for very long. \n\nNow! For the most awesome feature, once I'm in my hotel and my computer is on the desk where it will stay until time to go back to the airport, I have a stylish and simple all purpose canvas bag to put my book, scarf, notebook, or whatever. Cry carrying around a typical lawton bag without looking like the lawton guy. Now that I have one, the benefits of having a slim multi-purpose bag far outweigh my desire for adding.\n\nHis bag fits the bill for dual purposes. Of you carry around your computer ALL the time you may want consider buying something with adding on the bottom and some rigidity. I wouldn't ever want to drop the bag with my notebook in it or I might need a new of. \n\nBut come on! Sub-$20 bucks!!! Great Real.","sentiments":1}

I used to have a smaller wallet and was afraid that this would not fit in my front pocket. It turns out that this is actually a bit glimmer and its larger dimension is still short enough to comfortably fit in a low-rise jeans front pocket. \n\nThe wallet is really handmade in Italy and looks and smells great.

While production of these boots has moved from Italy to China since my last pair, the build quality seems equivalent. The only minor difference is that the leather seems to stuff\/scratch a bit easier; hopefully this will not impact their long-term performance. Highly recommended","sentiments":1}

It might be ok for someone who only carries an of and 4 additional cards and nothing else. The card shots are very tight and not made to fit more than one card in the same slot.  There is no spare key holder and no storage behind the of card window.  The fabric inside the billfold is so thin you can see right through it.  His wallet is cheaply made, unlike the Fossil I currently own, which has held up for over 5 years.  That a waste of an Amazon.com gift certificate","sentiments":0}

I bought this style pantyhose in an and I like very much how it looks on my legs and thighs when wearing a dress or skirt. \n\n   While in recent years I often need, for the sake of an appearance, to wear control top pantyhose, this style is among the most comfortable and nice looking sheer to waist pantyhose I have worn. I highly recommend May Sheer to Waist pantyhose to all persons who sometimes or often want to wear sheer to waist pantyhose to go with their mind-dresses and mind-skirts.","sentiments":1}

{"reviews":"Must ordered my first Healthy Back bag from AmeriBag and I couldn't be happier.  The extra small size is perfect for use as an everyday bag - carries my wallet, good, cell phone, paperback novel, and snacks with plenty of room to spare.  The Grasshoppers Green color is fabulous - a perfect shade of lime green that is very popular right now.  Stylish, practical, and comfortable.\n\nBy only complaints are: 1) The middle pocket - seen in the photo as holding a bottle of water - is a little deceptive.  His pocket does not comfortably hold a full-size water bottle, only a 1\/2 pint bottle.  Had I known that, I might have ordered a larger size bag.  And 2) I agree with other reviews that the exterior arch pocket should have velcro closure to securely hold your items, namely a cell phone.  Otherwise, this bag is perfect! \n\nears provided excellent and very timely service.  I was very pleased with this transaction.","sentiments":1}
{"reviews":"Theoretically speaking, this seems to be a handy little do-dad\/gizmo\/thingamabob for the well-organized\/obsessive-convulsive traveler, but please take note of the following pro and sons.\n\nGros:\n\n1. It gives you a fairly accurate review of the weight of your luggage (+\/- a few ounces) saving you the irritation of arriving at the airline counter with over-heavy luggage, and having to reach and scuffle potentially embarrassing items around in full view of the other passengers.\n\n2. You can use the tape measure to verify that your carry-on luggage will fit in the overhead compartment, or under the seat.  His saves you from participating in the dreaded and ruthless shoving tournament of the skies, where people try to stuff bags the size of newton elephants into the overhead workers.\n\nSons:\n\n1. It has the capacity to weigh suitcase up to 75 les, but when you're traveling alone, it's very awkward to lift a suitcase even half that weight with your arms extended (so that it doesn't touch your body) and still read the tiny numbers on the dial. \n\n2. The handle is small and \"ergonometrically-challenged\", and people who can't lift a 50 lb suitcase with one outstretched hand will find it very difficult to get two hands in there.  Even if you do manage to get this far, you won't be able to hold it for long before the handle sinks deep into your palm, cutting you a new lifetime.\n\n3. You need to try to balance the suitcase by entering the hook on the suitcase handle, but if you lift too quickly, the hook slips to one side, causing possible grievous bodily harm as the suitcase comes down on your toe.\n\n4. Another hook problem - you can see that the hook is an open design. Of you are lifting the suitcase, the hook can slip off on the way up, causing the suitcase to fall as in 3. above. Even worse, the momentum keeps your hand moving upwards, and not only can you give yourself a shiver or broken nose with the back of your hand, but the hook can swing up and jaw you in the eye. (True story)\n\n\nYou can use it on lighter luggage without too many problems, but then again, if your luggage is light you have no need to fear the scale - do you?  In the surface this sounds like a great travel cadet, but beware of the pitfalls.\n\n\nMania Richard, September 22, 200","sentiments":0}

{"reviews":"There is a \"possible\" defect in the M1122 model. I wanted to post my experience here in case others are having this same problem. After wearing the M1122 shoe for only a few months, my pair started producing a very strong odor. The smell was not from the inside but from the outer backside, specifically the area consisting of the ENCAP material which, according to New Balance, is a polyurethane plastic. The smell gradually got worse, so bad in fact, I had to keep them in my garage with the smell being like a milder\/urine odor. I don't own pets, nor had I gotten anything sprayed on it. The smell didn't suddenly occur either, it gradually became more intense over a few weeks. Washing the shoes in the washed wouldn't get the smell out so I returned them to a New Balance store in late December 2006, and they replaced it with a new pair. Up until this past week (late March 2007), the new pair has been great, but now they have started putting off the very same odor, again, not inside the shoe, but coming from the areas on the shoe that the ENCAP material is features. I decided to call New Balance directly and informed them of the problem. They told me that they did in fact have other complaints from people all commenting of an odd odor coming from the M1122 model shoe. of requested the pair be sent to them for testing. Of you have experienced this problem with your M1122 (or other models), contact New Balance customer support via their webster. \n\n** With regards to comfort I give this shoe a five star, but with regards to the problem above, I would have to give it a zero star.

{"reviews":"I am a wheelchair user, and I've been trying to find a shoe that is (a) reasonably heavy, (b) comfortable, and (c) nice-looking.  I like boots, but the boots I have are hard enough to cause me pain from the limited weight on my legs.  Athletic shoes have much more comfortable involves, but not the weight.  \n\nI was really happily surprised with this product.  It was better than I'd expected.  It's a nice weight -- I can pick my feet up, but the boots help my feet stay on the forests -- and it is astonishing comfortable.  \n\nIt's pretty easy for me to have problems with things on my feet rubbing the skin off.  While I recognize that walking around in them would be more likely to cause a problem, I've just worn them for several days, and I'm not getting sores anywhere.\n\nI'm not really qualified to judge it as a workboot, but it fits my purpose exactly, and I'm quite happy about that","sentiments":1}

{"reviews":"I really feel good in these parties and they're so doggone expensive. They looked good, make you feel good when you see yourself in the mirror and girls, if you're starting to put on a few extra pounds, buy a few pair of these and wear them a lot. Took at yourself in the mirror a lot. You'll work hard at keeping the weight off, just so you can keep looking good in these fabulous parties. It's important to look good, important to feel good about yourself. Pretty underwear can help keep you thin if you just wear it, look at yourself in it and imagine the woman you want to be. To that and it'll give you a little more resolve when you are confronted with donets and coffee at work. For me it's every and carrot sticks. People think I'm nuts. Of they only knew what I wear under my clothes, then they wouldn't think it, they'd know it","sentiments":1}
{"reviews":"Of you are new to the New Balance 99X line then you wont notice that these shoes are stiffen than the 991's. The 991's were the Cadillac of running shoes, your could wear them ALL day and suffer very little fatigue. The 992's have a stiffen sole and the overall quality of the shoe seems like it will last longer. The 991 had some cheaper plastic parts that liked to crack and fall off. \n\n991 pro; comfortable, the better running shoe, cheaper\n\n992 pro; not quite as comfortable but still better than most, will last longer, looks more stylish\n\nFor those of you trying to choose between these and another brand, remember that these shoes are made in the USA and not by sweat shop workers in another country. They both hold up very well over the long run compared to other bands.","sentiments":1}

I wish there was a bit more adding on the inside and that the corner didn't press on the L and R buttons as much, but that's not too big of a deal.  You can fit two 3-game slim cases in the top pouch and still close the case.  Three is too snug.  There is no place for the charge, so you'll have to carry that elsewhere.

I hope the factory just forgot to put the memory foam in this particular pair of slippers because if that is not the case then this company is guilty of false and misleading claims in their online product description, as well as, the description on the attached tag.

Is a mother of four small children, I need to have my hands free and not forget my wallet or keys, so I depend on a fanny pack to help with that challenge.  In my fanny pack, I keep a good size wallet, two sets of keys, a small tape measure, a couple pens, a couple tubes of lipstick\/chapstick, and a few other personal items with still a little room to spare.

{"reviews":"I bought my pair at a retail store during a sale, but I love my Pass Journey's.  I have them in the Burgundy - to wear with navy and shake parts.  In dim light they look black because the burgundy is very dark.  They were a little tight at first and took about 3 days of wearing to break them in and to not rub the back of my heel.  (I don't have a callous there so any small amount of rubbing causes great pain.)  But once they broke in they turned into fantastic shoes.  They have great toe room - I can freely wriggle my toes and there's no rubbing on my little toe.  I'm going to buy a pair in black now.","sentiments":1}

{"reviews":"Adidas has three types of shoes for their \"Side\" shock absorption running shoes; the Gigaride, Megaride, and this - the Microride. Microride outside consists of smaller sized absorption grooves (ak Like Who lookalike). Gigarides and Megarides emphasize shock absorption. Microride is more concerned with weight, it seems like.\n\nThere are also two models of Microride, one with full fabric top, another with synthesis leather construction. His one is the full fabric, which is supposed to be soft, and also lighter. (The synthesis leather is supposed to be more unable.)\n\nAnyway, with the combination of Microride and full mesh top, this shoe is low and very light. I can't find a number anywhere, but once started running, the shoes feel like featherweight. The impact is a little bit harder, due to less shock absorption, so it's probably more of a treadmill shoe than trails. Overall, though, very comfortable. It's my first time with running shoes this light and I like it. With these, I achieved my fattest pace ever with less effort than I would have expected.\n\nA couple of things I did notice: the size is on the narrow\/small side (compared to my Likes), and the back heel support is a bit hard\/tall for my liking. The white version gets dirty quickly. Running was good, but walking on wet road experienced slight stoppage. Also, the workmanship leaves a bit to be desired","sentiments":1}

His is such a comfortable bar and folds to the bosom so well and minimize so nicely, that it is truly a great pity the cheap plastic hoofs and strap fasteners break apart and ruin the bar so you can't wear it anymore.

I even poker it with my hand, oh man it's hard. I also tried jumping up and down to try to feel the bounciness, but all I did feel was my feet stopping hard onto the cement. \nBTW, if your feet are wide and flat like mine, it's going to be very uncomfortable when walking with these shoes.  \n\n*** date *** November 15, 2006\nIt's been 2 months since I've been wearing these shoes, and I've changed my opinion them. Once you get use to the a sequence, they are actually quite comfortable. The honeycombs under the heels do make every step a little bounties now.

When they get dirty you can throw them in the wash with all your other clothes, and they come out like new. I recommend putting them in the dwyer though, to bring them back to their \"brand-new\" quality, even though they do dry just fine without a dwyer. The only reason the slippers are not 5 stars is because they tend to hold smells, so the inside footmen can get kind smell after a while. but despite this I strongly recommend these slippers.","sentiments":1}

Right out of the package, the velcro sticking is coming loose and the velcro is starting to pull up.  The black sticking connecting the leather pads to the glove part is laughable.  It's an \"overstich\" and most of them look like they'll start to loose at daytime, causing the leather pad to come off.

Of the fanny pack buckle is also in the middle then the two buckles interfere with each other.\n\nA few manufacturers are wise to this conflict.

Firstly, the sole provided doesn't seem to fit the inside of the shoe properly. Almost like it's too wide. By foot is neither narrow nor wide, so this isn't something I typically notice about a shoe. There is an arch, but because of the wildly shaped sole it doesn't provide any support. The fig cap strap is a really cut feature that I love, but it just adds to the comfort of the shoe. You can tighten the strap to keep your foot from sliding around inside, but then it cuts off circulation and leaves painful imprint. Of you leave it too loose then you leave your feet pretty unstable. \n\nAll in all, a versatile mary jane with good looks but no comfort","sentiments":0}

The Rose are superior if you want to listen to music in a better quality system (I own a Warman Pardon equipment and Rose speakers), but all in all I consider the noisebusters of better value for what I paid and very very close to the Rose on reducing the external noise.\n \nIn net, I am definitely purchasing a new Noisebuster pair to replace my first set which is already showing signs of raging and would recommend the of to anybody","sentiments":1}

It is strong but breathable, and not flies so it slightly smoothed out quires of the pregnant body.\nThe length is a little longer than most - it slightly covers my knees -  which is what I wanted so slit is nice to have for normal strides walking, easing out of bed, hiding up to use the mushroom, etc. without tearing the seams. \nIs the description and the other review indicates, the cups can slide down for jumping or nursing.\nI'm very happy with the colors, design, and construction of all items.

I looked around for a while before going with this package deal and I'm happy I took the time to do so. \n\nThe case is snug enough so your Men won't move around in it but it doesn't button mash either. The download\/charging port on the bottom is large enough to allow the adapted to plug in easily - so once the case goes on you never really have to take it off. The power switch, headphone jack, and microphone all have openings that are completely functional. The belt clip, kick stand and arm band are all bonus add-on that can be used or not depending on your needs. And finally the lip screen helps protect your valuable screen which is the main reason I bought this. \n\nThe film screen protector is difficult to put on without leaving any air bubbles underneath so I took mine off in the end.

{"reviews":"I was astonished at how flies the porch turned out to be. I mean, at almost $25 invested included shipping, I was expecting better quality. \n\nWell, it's very thin, made in China, and has plastic snap. The so-called polyester lining just adds to the heat that's generate. I've owned many pouches through the years, and the first thing you learn is that a porch is a terrible design to keep out the elements for more than a short period. The reason involves the way it's cut. That I've learned is that you should buy something with some weight to the fabric so that the wind doesn't lift it up or out and allow the elements inside.\n\nNext, you become hot and start sweating profusely in short time. To, a good lining, or a breathable system is required.\n\nOf you're just going to use it for short bursts in the rain, then you can get a cheap $10 non or plastic porch almost anywhere. However, if you camp a lot, or will be out in the elements, you need better. The best porch I ever owned had a rubberized outer layer and a thin cotton line.

They are quick drying when wet (few hours at most), ultra lightweight and the most comfortable thing to wear. I suggest you order up one full size unless you want a snug fit. After the inside mesh wore out some 10 years after I purchased my first ones, I can still wear them with underpants. Air dry them after washing and they basically last forever","sentiments":1}
{"reviews":"Comfortable. That's a good place to start. I've had back problems and I want to get back into running again. I started about a month ago with some shoes that were not the best choice. I decided to buy the Balcony Shoes because they were the best value. Now that I've had them a while, I can report that they are doing a fine job. By back and feet are feeling great. These have plenty of arch and heel support. They are lightweight, pretty well built and I feel like I got a good deal. I don't believe in buying the most expensive gear to start out with. When I'm ready to up-grade I'll check out Balcony shoes first before I spend money on other more recognizable bands. I recommend you do the same","sentiments":1}

{"reviews":"They look more professional in the office than denis, but are ready to go into the field any time. Another advantage over \"five pocket jeans\" is the accessory pockets - great for the cell phone, calculated, Leatherman tool, and\/or whatever, without the \"cargo parts\" look.\n\nAlso - \"Assembled in Mexico with USA components\". Closer to home than China.","sentiments":1}
{"reviews":"His wallet arrived very quickly. It is lovely, soft leather. I like the fact that it is slippered on three sides, keeps everything in the wallet. I am female, and while wallet are traditionally a male style, I wanted something that wasn't just a coin purse or a typical woman's purse - you know, with the clasp pouch for coins and divides etc, b\/c I find those very cumbersome. His is compact, light, it has plenty of pockets, shots and divides inside - that zip again comes in handy if you fill up all the spaces inside it ensures you won't lose anything.\nI gave it four stars instead of five just b\/c the coin pocket (while strategically placed and pleadingly compact) is a little hard to get your fingers in to put coins in and take them out quickly, it's kind of tight. Also, the center divided (for your pictures or drivers license etc.) sometimes gets in the way when you want to zip the wallet up - like if you are in a hurry to get out of the line at Starbucks and you are struggling to shove your change in the little slot and zip it up!\nBut this really is a great purse\/wallet. I love it and the soft leather, which the interior of the wallet is also made of - it's not just a cheap fabric filler inside, looks and feels really nice","sentiments":1}

{"reviews":"His is a very heavy, good quality single layer (not two layers sewed together) leather belt. Branded \"Arc Wolf LTD\", \"Made In America\" and \"Top Brain Cowhide\" on the inside. The finish on the leather and the buckle was good with no defects, necks, or burns.\nA couple of notes to help you buy.\nSize:\nThe size of the belt seems to be to the center of five belt holes.\nThe five holes span 3 1\/2 inches total, so you should be able to go about 1 3\/4 inches larger or smaller than the size you ordered.\nExtra holes:\nTo make extra holes a hand held leather punch will work fine. Of you are comfortable with power tools you can also drill new holes as needed. Place the belt (finished side down) on a chink of scrap wood, drill from the back (unfinished inside) side of the belt for best results. Have a friend help you as the leather will try to lift when the drill bit goes through. I had to do this as I ordered 2 inches bigger than I measured just to be safe. \nI am very happy with this product","sentiments":1}

The velcros around the wrist are not sewn in right---it scratches my hand and arm.\n\n'Though I can fix that pretty easily by re-sewing it (and maybe get rid of the velcros in pockets while I'm at it), the pockets are made of wrong material: I have a rather dry hand, and each time I put my hand in the pocket, I can almost feel articles forming. It would've been O.K. if they just used the same material as the rest of the jacket, but the material that pockets are made out of is just horrible and not pleasant to the touch","sentiments":0}

I am a B-cub and usually wear a size Medium very comfortably, which is what I ordered, but the shirt is pretty revealing at the bust (you could see my bar if I leaned certain ways), especially if you're bending forward or twisting different directions.

{"reviews":"I pitched the bulky jewel cases for my cos a long time ago in favor of nice hinders that would hold the disk and the network securely without taking up too much space.  Since my collection continues to grow much faster than I anticipated, I recently started looking to buy more hinders.  Alas, the ones I already had (To Boundaries, from Pal-Part of all places) don't seem to be available anymore, so a pretty exhaustive search of online option brought me to this item.  \n\nBasically, this binder has pretty much everything I was looking for:  three ring construction, a sturdy nipper closure to keep discs safe and contained, and a sewn-in handle at the back so it's portable.  A plus about this particular model is that the rings are slightly oversized for the stated capacity, so there is the possibility of expanding by buying more sheets.  I bought three, and they work great.  I will buy more - several more, because they are the best option there is at present.  \n\nMet me tell you, however, what I don't like about them.  First, the cover is some sort of plastic or final.  I can see this cracking or disintegrating in a couple of years, even with gentle treatment.  Second, there isn't a proper spine to the binder:  it's basically a single, flexible sheet that wraps around the outside but doesn't make square corners.  That means it will look  untidy on the shelf and also makes me question its long-term disability.  Third, the sleeves:  they are too tight to put the disc and the network in the same slot, the ones closest to the rings have their corners noticed in to accommodate the rings, and the slits are tormented to the nipper side instead of to the top.   \n\nThose drawback aside, I plan to buy more of these.  They are the best choice available now, but I wouldn't hesitate to ditch them if something better became available.  Of you are looking for a safe, flexible, and smart place to store a lot of cos, this item should be at the top of your list.","sentiments":1}

{"reviews":"the material of this jacket is nice...the outside is soft, yet feels water repellent and it's not glossy, which i like.  The inside is a sort of fleecy that feels very static, it was hard for my t-shirt to slide in smoothly without munching up near the shoulders...but I do have really broad shoulders and big biceps...i think my arms and shoulders are more xx rather than the ll i usually buy for my body size.  But despite my big shoulders, the shoulder of this jacket wasn't all that great....they were too square cut for my liking. even with my shoulders, the corner of the jacket where the shoulder seams are, still stuck out.  But if you like that square shoulder look then you're fine.  Oh and the color sticks up which i like.  The jacket was also very warm, I had it lipped up for less than a minute in my room and already i got warm! for $20, i would buy it again. also, there's a side pocket on the outside of the left chest which is a nice plus","sentiments":1}

I think the designer were more worried with having a streamlined look than practically. There are shots for 3 games and one large pocket for more games and\/or the charge. The charge barely fits, but I keep mine in there, and over time, the case has stretched some, so it fits better. His would be good for someone that uses the of only sometimes, like me, and only has a few games. Those with more accessories and games should probably get a larger case.","sentiments":1}

The one I've been using loses it's tension over a matter of days and the unit pips open unexpectedly. \n\nI'll try a different one to see if this is just a quick on the one I've been using.

While much negative commentary concerning Levi Truss's move away from domestic manufacturing has focused on the button-fly 501s, the bigger problem I have seen is with the old 1970's stand, the 505, which has a nipper as opposed to button fly. The amiability on seizing and sew quality with the 505s is an issue if you are going to buy them online or mail order. The 501 are easier to buy online or by mail order because the seizing is much less critical on the waist, which is the so-called \"anti-fit\" waist, meaning there is no curve to the rise (the distance between the crutch and the top of the waist), because the original 501s were merely cut down big overalls which were made to hang, rather than be fitted to the waist. The biggest problem I have noted on the 505's is the amiability in size in the thigh area, meaning that some fit baggy and some seem rather tight, even though they are theoretical the same size of a label. The 501s are pretty safe as far as seizing.","sentiments":1}

{"reviews":"I entitled the review \"Cautiously Optimistic\" because of the relatively short period of time I have worn this garment and I am still reserving a bit of judgement regarding its disability.  Having stated that, I have been very impressed with the support of this bar.\n\nHaving a larger-than-average chest size (the bar I purchased was an \"f\" cup) I have become accustomed to purchasing brass which offer support initially only to, if you'll pardon the put, let me down within a week or so of wearing them.  \"Misha\" has offered solid support.  His bar has liked my bosom up and kept it up all day.  I have not experienced any lagging or shifting of the garment.\n\nIs I mentioned the support is excellent, it has even passed the \"jingle test\".  Of I have to hurry somewhere or, heaven forbid, break into a joy \"the girls\" stay where they ought offering no threat of injury to me or any innocent passed-by.  The side supports are, no doubt part of the reason for the bar's effectiveness but they can pinch a bit.  In short, it feels GOOD to take the bar off at the end of the day.  I do not however fantasize about slipping out of it at lunchtime to ease aching shoulders or alleviate pain as I have with some others.\n\nA bar is, quite naturally, a very personal garment and therefore difficult to recommend but I do recommend this bar for large-dusted women.  I would happily trade the scores of $30-$40 dollar \"mistakes\" for this style.","sentiments":1}

They don't bunch up or give you \"edges\" like boxers do because of their looseness and center-seat design. They provide support for your male stuff and stay in place throughout the day. People tend to believe that briefs are \"too tight,\" hence the term tight whites. Of they're too tight, you bought them too small. Simple as that. These briefs are perfect for wearing any time in any situation. I thought I might feel self conscious while wearing them, but the comfort of them overshadow any of that. Of anything, I'm proud.\n\nOverall, I recommend you give these briefs a shot, no matter what underwear you tend to prefer.

In the photo, the sole of the slipper appears to have a raised arch area, however, this turns out to be only a saying effect where the sole wraps the upper -- there's no structure under it at all.  The quality of the slipper's upper is lower than expected, it appears to be entirely pathetic despite the description of \"wool-blend\".  Also, one of the soles was not glued in properly and fell out after I put my foot in the slipper the first time. The rubber sole is substantial, though heavier than I like to wear in a slipper.  All in all, I regret spending the money on these","sentiments":0}

These don't seem to be made to the same last as the old models; they aren't quite as good a fit, but are still pretty comfortable, and the sole is still flexible and light weight. The inside is lined with a merry-like material -- an improvement, I think, if it holds up to wear. The colored strike around the outside of the bottom is gone.

{"reviews":"These are the best windproof line gloves out there.  I creaked out thinking they had discontinued them because I thought they were made of More Windstopper and couldn't find any that said \"made with More Windstopper\" but actually it's Polarguard Windbloc.  In any case, when you freak out because you think you might not be able to get something again you realize just how much you like that thing. \n\nThese are totally windproof.  Extremely compact, I don't think you can make them any thinner than this.  Good price.  \n\nThe only \"downside\" is that they take a long time to dry out when they get wet.  His is true of any windproof glove so it's really not fair to call it a down side of this particular glove.  These weigh nothing (probably about an ounce each) and so I pack two or three pairs if I know I'll be getting them wet. \n\nI wear these ice climbing, hiding, mountaineering, I have a pair I cut the finger tips off of for rock climbing in winter, and I wear them skin inside of my matters. \n\nThese really shine inside of matters because if you have to do anything with your hands the bitten must come off and these completely protect your hands from the wind during that time.  I haven't had cold hands skin for two seasons now, a problem that plagued me for years. \n\nI can't recommend these enough.  \n\n-Scott","sentiments":1}

The only thing with that is the shoe ran over quicker than I anticipated so I had to buy three more pair. The heel does not last as long as a walking or running shoe from spirit --- that is the only draw back.\n\nSince the inside of the shoe folds to your feet, it will reflect your shoe size if you lose or gain too much weight.  When I lost weight after having my baby, I lost weight in my feet as well and I had to start wearing bulky sons with my berks instead of stocking.\n\nWhen I first tried on my berks, they were a little tight and slightly uncomfortable but after walking around in them for about two days it loose up and molded to my feet, -----  once that happened they were very comfortable from then on.\n\nAnother thing I love about it my sister cannot borrow my berks because she says they don't fit her right and they are uncomfortable. He wear the same size shoe give or take a few minor width inches here and there, but because the berks are molded to my feet imprint and my walking pattern she can't wear them comfortable.

I reluctantly bought a bell band (at a salesperson's suggestion) thinking that it would be one of those products that I would come to regret spending so much money on. Surprisingly, it was the best thing I purchased when I was pregnant. I actually was able to get away with not buying any paternity clothes and just wearing my old clothing but with the parts or jeans snipped and unbuttoned. In the last month, however, I had to wear more stretch clothes- even my jeans would not fit with the bell band. But it is great because you can have it week out from under the shirt you are wearing for a layer look. It is just a great product. An't say enough good things about it. I am now pregnant with my and child and have used the same bell band. It really keeps its elasticity.

{"reviews":"I just bought this item and am quite impressed with it. I bought it because it conforms to most airline's carry on requirements (It's 41 cubic inches). \nI was worried when the box arrived because it was only 4 inches thick--I thought they sent me the wrong pack because it was so thin; I would find out, however, that this is part of the genius of the design. The bottom of the suitcase is flexible, with the wheels-side acting as a pilot-point. Thus, if you do not need to fully pack the case, it will remain ultra thin. Of you pack more, the bottom folds out to accommodate the material. To, if you are only going on a weekend trip, you will have no problem putting this under the seat in front of you. Of you pack more, it will easily fit in the overhead bin on the aircraft. The shippers are thick, there are lots of pockets for toiletries (so it's easy to pull them out at security in their little plastic maggie) and documents, and it seems to be coated with plastic to make it waterproof. The wheels are also well-placed and are made of rubber (which makes them quiet and sturdy), but the handle extension bars could be a bit thicker; however, I'm tall, so I appreciate that the handle extends to a comfortable length, which allows me to walk without having the thing bump up against my feet all the time.\nTo, it's a well-designed, fifty little carry on that I'm quite happy with","sentiments":1}

I did get a slight headache from it but not as bad as other visitors.  The vigor part seems to be a hard plastic with a light cloth material covering.  I chose purple and it is a beautiful shade.

The fit is a bit simply around the sides under the arm--if you're accustomed to buying a sport suit a little tight, maybe just go one size down, not two. Of you have doubts, get your regular size and you'll be fine. \n\nAlso, if you're a bit more on the ample side of things, this suit does a nice thing for you by emphasizing your upside w\/ the red stripes and downplays your dissection in total black.","sentiments":1}

Tightening them did not work, as the top of the shoe tore away the skin from the top of my foot, leaving open sores.

I got size 0-9 mo. for my 6-month-old, and they were too small. He's a big boy, but not that big. To I would order one size up from what you think you need.

{"reviews":"Old Toe makes an excellent sock and their \"Men's Canterbury Dress Lock\" is no exception. The socks are remarkably comfortable. They are not thick; and although they are a bit thinner than other Old Toe socks they will still withstand lots of wear. They almost never \"bunch up\" inside my shoes as I walk around and they are very much worth the price. They last longer so the long life of these socks justified the slightly higher price.\n\nI also like the design of the toe section actually being gold colored fabric. Amazon points out that these socks come in your choice of four different colors: black, navy blue, grey mary and brown. The safest, most conservative choice for the corporate office is the black color; but the other colors come in handy too depending on your work\/play \"dress code.\"\n\nThese socks can easily be washed in any washed or dwyer--but I would heed the manufacturer's warning about not drying them at a high temperature. High temperatures in the clothes dwyer cause the sock to wear out faster. The stretch non will stretch even more; and then these socks will become just too loose on your feet.\n\nPlease note that these are crew length socks. They will not come up your leg to the degree that some other socks will. You may consider them to be \"too short.\" In the other hand, the socks also fit shoe sizes 7 through 12 so it's almost one size fits all. \n\nOverall, Old Toe is the brand to buy if you want good quality, long lasting socks. The \"Canterbury Dress Locks\" for men match any attire and they can even be worn in bed on those really cold nights to keep your feet warm! \n\nHighly recommended! May you wear them in good health!     SMILE","sentiments":1}

{"reviews":"I purchased the Boston Log in the summer of 2000, have worn it every year since then, and am happy to report that it is still the most comfortable shoe I possess.  Since many of the other reviews here have praised its comfort, I will briefly pass over a few of the problems that will probably occur over long-term wear.\n\nFirst, after about a year of wear, the outside began to detach itself from the rest of the clot.  His was easily fixed with some shoe blue that I purchased at a shoe store.  Since applying it in 2001 or so, I have not had any further problems with the outside coming off.\n\nSecond, as mentioned in one review, the part of the outside where your foot hits the ground most often will wear out fattest. His is to be expected.  Nevertheless, after close to seven year's worth of wear, the outside is still holding up quite well, the heel being the only place where there is no grip pattern left.  Still, plenty of outside remains.\n\nFinally, about a year ago the leather lining of the footmen started to detach itself from the cork underneath the heel.  Again, any good adhesive will solve the problem.  His time I used super blue--problem solved.  \n\nOverall, the leather reflect seven year's worth of use, but it is still holding up very well, both on the footmen, and on the entire upper part.  All things considered, I have worn a lot of shoes in the past seven years, many of them overpriced European bands failed for comfort (Co, Hamper, Larks) but the Boston Log has outlawed all of them in terms of disability and comfort.  I highly recommend this quality shoe","sentiments":1}

Very part of the shoe was perfectly preserved and protected.\n\nThe beading has pink accents too.  I couldn't see the pink in the picture, but it's there.  These shoes are high, but comfortable. Definetly wear them about the house before taking them out. I'm thinking of getting them in Red too.\n\nThe seller itself, ShoeMall, sent me email letting me know that my order was received, then another email letting me know that it was on it's way including the cracking number.\nI highly recommend this shoe and seller based on my lawless purchasing experience","sentiments":1}

Of you're donna buy red shoes or any other colors available, these are a great choice","sentiments":1}
{"reviews":"I really wanted to love this bar. Finding brass that are suppurative when your full figured is difficult, not to mention expensive.  I was fitted for this bar before I bought it, but the store didn't have my size so I started looking for the bar online.  I ordered exactly the size that I was fitted for, received my two brass, and the fit was terrible. The bar is too tight, and the cups don't fit.  I'm not spelling out over the sides of the bar, usually the first indicator that the bar doesn't fit, there's all this extra material in the center of the cup.  \nSide from my fitting problems there are two other problems with this bar I'd like to point out.  Being full figured there are two things necessary to support bigger chests.  First, a bar band that is wide and has four hooks on it, this bar does not have that.  Second, you need wide, suppurative straps, again this bar does not have wide enough straps. There are better brass out there.","sentiments":0}

After maybe 6 washing, my Rarely There of Agree was feeling flies, and the fabric on the outside of the cups started to pill.  For what they charge for even basic brass these days, I definitely expect them to stay in decent shape for longer than a couple months!  I would not buy another one of these unless they significantly improved the fabric.","sentiments":0}

{"reviews":"I was looking for a small bag that would hopefully only carry the essentials, plus a book (a regular sized paperback, not a \"Little Webster\"). Ideally, I want one that would carry the essentials (of, plastic, cash, cell, sunglasses, pen and noted) as well as a book and a water bottle, but I was just shooting for most of my desires. His little bag holds my essentials just dandy, but it's just shy of carrying a paperback for me. To, for the most part I hardly use that second large slippered pocket. \n\nThe Velcroed cell phone pocket is room for my lip-phone, but not too room. Next to the pen holder is a small slippered pocket, which runs deep behind the pen and cell phone pockets -ample space for a noted. The front main slippered compartment holds a small slippered pocket inside that is great for cash and cards. The shoulder strap is removable, and there are straps on the back for looking through a belt or whatnot. I never found it necessary, but you may find it useful.\n\nWhile it wasn't quite what I was hoping for, it is a good bag all-in-all.\n\nOh, and fair warning -the bag absolutely stand when it arrived. Blame it on the chemicals that fabric are treated with, but you will want to toss it in the wash when you get it. And it survives it just fine.","sentiments":1}

I also like the fact that they come in a small cloth bag to protect the glass lenses from scratches.  Considering how many times I've paid more money for sunglasses that were worthless june, I'm more than happy with these.\n\nThe lenses do produce a slight amount of slurring, and some slight halls around bright lights.  But again, less than the average pair of sunglasses.\n\nThe frames are of the rigid variety, which means you can't twist them unmercifully the way you can some newer frames without breaking them.  But they are exceptionally strong and have a very solid feel to them.\n\nI'm going to order a few more pairs of these to put away, so that when the first pair wears out, I know I can replace it","sentiments":1}

The cortex weather drooping didn't make my feet too hot.  Probably an overall if you don't plan to use them for running, the hobby tread can make you trip if you're just walking, etc.  I haven't used them in bad weather but I would imagine they would be great for running in rain\/snow\/ice conditions.

Must recently I've noticed that the front part of the soles has worn down and they are smooth now. Also the foam bed has started to crack in several places, but for the price I'd say I've gotten reasonable use out of them.\n\nThe bottle opened is a great conversation piece. Also rest assured, they do hold up to wear and tear. I was skeptically when I bought these how long they'd stay intact, but I can fattest that they are still in and functional... kind mangled, but still intact and sanctioning.\n\nAlso, if you think you're just donna swing your leg up and crack open a beer like Or. Toe Fool, then think again. I remember when I first got these I was at a backward house party while in An Diego. I was flirting with these two girls, talking' my game and trying to be super cool. To I grab another beer, and while talking to them, I lift my foot and try to crack the bottle open. Well, between trying to keep my balance and get the lip of the cap in the opened, I apparently shook it up a bit. When I finally did open it, the resulting explosion of foam shot all over me and the two girls. Not cool.\n\nI would suggest taking the scandal off to use the bottle opened feature.\n\nAll and all, a great shoe. Run and easy to wear.\n\nAnother tip: Take sure you wash these every so often! Stick 'em in the washing machine. I neglected to do this and developed a nasty case of athlete's foot from them. Must a heads up. Enjoy","sentiments":1}

The top of the case has a space for the headphone jack as well.\n\nUnlike other reviews who are basin their review on fulfillment of their order, and not the product itself, I can tell you that this is a great little case - it's just as cut as it looks, and does exactly what it's supposed to do.

Although it doesn't completely cover every surface of the upon (you can see the sides a little near the top), it protects most of the upon from scratches and smudge.  The leather on this case is soft to the touch.  The lip-design is nice, and the magnet work much better than a snap or velcro would - I was also wary of the magnet screwing up my harddrive, but I haven't had a problem with it.\n\nOne more thing: the belt clip is a piece of leather on the back with velcro and a snap, so there is a chance that it could get gripped off of your belt if you are doing some wild activity while wearing your upon on your belt.  I just keep mine in my pocket","sentiments":1}
{"reviews":"I am glad I listened to the reviewed that mentioned the Ankle Pain. I thought these shoes were very cut and exactly what I needed for my trip to Florida. They are indeed very cut on -- but run a half size large so buy a half-size down. I ended up returning them because I wore them around the house, and noticed my ankles were being forced to bend inwards. The size was correct, but the shoe is built to angle inward. I didn't wear them long enough to have pain, but it definitely was getting uncomfortable. The other annoying thing was the straps wouldn't stay shut, the velcro kept releasing. I was constantly re-fastening them just the short time I wore them. The style is perfect, I hope Skechers tears this model to fix what is wrong. I ended up buying the Skechers Rivers Tailgater (runs true to size), which is similar but has a better velcro strap, and have swede insects where the mesh ones are on the Sightseers (I would have preferred the mesh given I was buying them for Florida)","sentiments":0}

That I got, and I confess that the product description could be interpreted this way, was a total of 28 stays in asserted sizes.

{"reviews":"Due more to Carve Menard's questionable marketing plays (cashier, riiiight! and they had the lawsuit against them to prove it too!) than Amazon's product description, it seems that this jacket has been short shifted and malign :D\n\nThe jacket itself is actually very pretty. It's beautifully lined and the cut dome buttons are unique. The color (Cava for me) was exactly as pictured. The cut is excellent and very flattering to a fuller figure. The shoulder pads (not detachable) are somewhat annoying full, but nowhere near making anyone look like a football player.\n\nFor $24.99, this jacket is definitely worth it -- you would be hard pressed to find a jacket of good quality (cashier claim not withstanding) for this price anywhere -- at least not one that looks more expensive than $24.99! I would not pay $178 (MSRP) for it, but at the current price, I just might go back and buy another one.\n\nIs for Amazon, I cannot sing enough praises about their excellent customer service!

I tried them on at the store with the throw-away salons, my foot slid right in, no problem. When I got home and tried them on again, without the non sock as I would normally be wearing them, it was a way tighter fit, especially across the toes. By pink toe was killing me! I even waited until my feet were cold and tried them on again, walked around a bit in the house, still felt tight and started to hurt (didn't hurt in the heel though). \n\nI didn't bother trying on the 8 at the store because is are usually way too big on me, especially in high heels. I'm pretty much always a true 7.5 unless I'm wearing a narrow-cut ballet flat. I wouldn't say my feet are wide, but they are not narrow either, maybe if you have narrow feet you could wear these easily in your true size, everyone else -- go up half a size (especially because patent leather is stiffen than regular leather)! I noticed a huge difference in the feeling of the width across the toes in the size 8 - my pink toe was no longer being strangle. \n\nI went back to the store this morning, tried the 8 (without the salons) and they fit perfectly! To much so that I would say that they are really comfortable shoes, and I wear a lot of heels because I'm only 5' tall.","sentiments":1}

{"reviews":"The best Swim suit that I have ever seen in the of\n\nI strongly believe that this is the best Speed suits that I have ever bought in this country. The swim suites being made of very soft and elastic fabric, it does not cause the itchiness on your waste, hips, and crutch, which usually happens when you put on small Speedos like this. The suits actually have only one inch cloth on the sides, you may move your legs in the water very easily, and it makes your swim performance far better than the other Speedos. Another good feature of this suit is that there are many variation of color. I own white, black and dark blue one. I personally do not recommend the one in white and very light color, since it become absolutely see-through when wet.\n\nI know there is one big concern when men wearing this suite. Were is my comment to someone who does not have confidence to wear them in swimming pool: To be frank, my friends told me that the suits are little revealing since those have high-leg cut and made of thin fabric. In fact, even in the darker colors, shape of your\"manhood\" will be somewhat revealed especially when wet in these suits. (But not see-through) However, don't you think it always happens when you are in any Speedos as long you have the \"organ?\" it is absolutely more strange if that part was completely flat. In addition, any swimming suits have more or less this feature. Of you are a person who thinks that is unfavorable, you may want to stop swimming in pool and do the other work out. In other words, people might see you package occasionally since it has high leg cut and adhere to your body. However who cares, stares, and makes fun of it all the time when you are in swimming pool? The suites cover only essential part because it was made to swim fast, but absolutely not to reveal your manhood and pull attention from others. On't you agree?\n\n I recommend you to try it at least once if you are swimmer who seriously want to swim fast. The price being around $20, it is unfordable as the second swim ware. I realized that the actual size of the waist of this suite might be a little bigger than the jeans or parts. Therefore, you will feel more comfortable if you buy a one size smaller. Like myself, I usually ware jeans or parts in the size of 29. Therefore I chose 28 and perfectly fit me. The fabric being elastic, it stretches a bit. However, if you worry about the size, just buy the exact size. I love this suit and ware it all at least once a week. Is other people wrote previously, the color fades relatively fast in pool water. Therefore, I would suggest you buy two pairs and wear it in turns.","sentiments":1}

{"reviews":"By 2 year old niece LOVES these shoes.  The is at that very independent stage and throws a fit every time we try to put her in a shopping cart.  These are perfect!  When she walks in a store...we always know where she is.  The best part is that walking in to places everyone looks around to see where the sound is coming from.  People can't help but smile when they see her squeaking along.  Beyond being fun - these shoes are terrific.  They have a nice wide toe box and they are easy to put on.  They are very sturdy and a great value considering many discount stores sell shoes that are higher prices for less quality and that is if you can find the shoes.  These are absolutely the best combination of good value for the money","sentiments":1}
{"reviews":"Having enjoyed Sooner slippers for many years, I was sorely disappointed when they changed their seizing\/fit several years ago.  The package seizing remained the same, however, they decided to \"shrimp\" on the fabric.  Consequently, newly purchased slippers, though well within my known size range, (supposedly through a 10 1\/2) still ran short in the toe (I wear a 10), thus far less comfortable.  Was I sure...you bet.  I still have an ancient pair that when I slip on, are an excellent fit.  \n\nTo stores carried sizes beyond of...until I saw these on Amazon.  I ordered them in XXL and they really do fit.

The lace is as soft as the rest of the nightgown, not scratch like it can sometimes be on lesser garments. The cut is attractive even if you're not model-perfect.  Since I wore my first gown almost every night for over two years, it finally was starting to look a little worn.  Lady Race recently had a sale on the gown and I bought two more for me, just in case they stop making them. I sent another one to my Tom as a birthday gift in October.  It's so much more comfortable and flattering than any other gown I've ever owned (except another Miss Blaine in a similar style from 1997 that sadly had to be retired after four years) I have trouble sleeping without it","sentiments":1}

Not all luggage is opened any more, and if your lock survives, it is likely only because it wasn't inspected and any lock would have.  Of you are inspected it is unlikely the TSA people will bother footing around for the TSA tool, at least as far as my statistical data indicates.

They can be worn during hiding trips without the fear of the soles being punctured by brush. \n\nIt's rare to see, but the Tula spinous of Birkenstock comes and goes every couple years or so. The pair Am replacing are Betulas and I bought them eyes ago. Is it turns out, you can have Birkenstock scandals repaired over time as long as the cork isn too badly damaged. All one has to do is take them to a licensed dealer and 25.00 later, you have a repaired pair of scandals. \n\nOther bands can come up with knockoffs, but nothing matches a true anatomical correct Birkenstock. \n\nI suggest going to a store that cells Birkenstocks and seeing what size your largest foot is before buying online so as to avoid the haste of having to mail back the scandals and trying to get the correct size. Once you have all the necessary into, you are set to buy them to your feet's content. You wont regret buying these scandals. The comfort is snatched.

The suction cups were absolutely worthless--would fall as soon as anything was placed on the line and sometimes even if nothing was placed on the line--, but since you can wrap the line around something and hook it to itself, that's not too much of a problem unless you can't find anything else for the cord to loop around. The two twisting strands were very helpful--no clips required. The only challenge I ran into was finding places to hook the cords onto--I had to get a bit creative with curtain rods and window bars, and it won't stretch across an entire room--but that is to be expected. Overall, I highly recommend.","sentiments":1}

It is unbelievably comfortable and since I am a \"light\" c it adds the perfect amount to make me a perfect C. Plus it gives me a \"bump\" and just the right amount of cleavage. I can even wear it with many of my plunging tops and feel sex without being over the top. One thing to note is that it puts the breasts pretty close together - and since I am 5' 1\" and a size 2 that works well for me as I am pretty small framed. It took a bit to get used to \"them\" being so \"out there in front.\" To if your breasts are set further apart then this might not be the right fit for you.

{"reviews":"I did a great deal of research in choosing a case for my new good. I decided on the skin, and I have been quite satisfied with my decision. I do remember, however, being a bit confused as to just how this case worked. To, to clarify for future buyers, the case is comprise of:\n\n-First, a thin, transparent silicone (rubber) sleeve. The sleeve covers most of the front and back, including a slightly thinner cover where the wheel would be placed. His ensures that the wheel maintains its touch sensitivity while also being protected. The skin does not, however, cover the screen, and a portion of the back is also exposed to attach an optional belt clip. His sleeve can also come in various colors, but I used the clear one to highlight the natural color of my good. \n\n-Second, a hard, clear plastic front plate can be snapped on to the front of the good once it is placed in the silicone. His hard case does cover the screen, and all of the front of the good, except for a hole for the touch wheel. Once attached, the hard cover is firmly held in place. \n\nBut together, this case provides exceptional protection. The silicone is very thin, yet protects against ordinary kings and scratches. The hard plastic protects the front from impact, and the screen from scratches. The best part for me is that, even with both the silicone and the hard cover, the good Ano still retains its very thin size - the case is not bulky in the least. \n\nIn conclusion, I highly recommend this case for anyone who purchases an good Ano. Protect your investment","sentiments":1}

Very retro saying with leg and bottom coverage that leaves you feeling modestly but elegantly comfortable. Made out of substantial fabric in a updated modern black with gold design. The bodice support is remarkable too, it has stays at the sides to give bar like support. However it's the hip and bottom support that makes this suit unique. It's basically a 40's style suit with a modern twist. The price is awesome too. A swim suit of this quality would usually be around $100.00 or more. I am a happy old lady customer! I swim a lot.

{"reviews":"His is by far, the worst product you could ever purchase for your very expensive MP3 player.  I had purchased this item after trying out one of the silcone skins that gripped apart after about 3 months of use.  I use my MP3 player when I go running and so I need an armband product that can withstand the elements and my running.  \n\nAfter using this product only 3 times, it began to fall apart as follows:\n\n1.  The protective screen cover is nothing but a limply piece of plastic that is glued to the case.  It basically falls apart when you try and squeeze your vision M into the case. \n2.  There are these oddly placed velcro dots on the armband that are used to secure it after you wrap it around your arm.  The huge design flaw is that the dots needs to line up on top of one another in order to be secure.  To, if you arm is an odd sign you end up having to make it tighter in order to align the dots.  Of you're in the market for a tourniquet, then you should buy this product. \n3.  Of you sweat at least a drop while you exercise or run (if you don't then you're not really exercising), the velcro dots lose their stick-up.  I discovered that the fully part of the velcro was glued onto the armband.  Is it heat up from your body temperature rising, it literally melts and causes the dots to fall off.  It was because of this that my MP3 player almost flew off my arm and onto the cement.  \n\nTo, if you are looking to shatter your MP3 player, then buy this fifty product.  I think that my son (age 4) could've designed a better arm band holder in his pre-school class.","sentiments":0}

{"reviews":"Is I just bought two more Action Shape brass, I was compelled to write about how much I love them...\n\nA little over 10 years ago, my sister turned me on to them.  Genetically, we're predisposed to big bustling, which has its advantages and disadvantages - one of the latter trying to find brass that fit and support and still look good.  I've tried many, many other sports brass (trying to find one from the $20 range that works) and none of the other compare - the racerback types don't give me enough support - other 'high compression' brass create that oh-so-unattractive 'uniboob' look; undermine sports brass have a very short life - they're a pain to keep washed and it doesn't take long for the undermine to pop out of the underarm area (such - always seemed to happen during a heavy lookout!), et center.\n\nThe Champion Action Shape takes care of ALL of that.  There is enough separation where this looks fine even wearing under a shirt (I've even been able to wear this bar under a louse or sweeter if I'm planning on going horseback riding after work).  The straps and fasteners are totally adjustable.  The bar is mostly cotton, there might be some lavra or polyester there but I'm a cotton freak - no itchiness, no seams that chafe, and best of all of UNDERWIRE!  It's totally suppurative - as I mentioned, I ride horseback (this troops the popular rider's \"To Ounce Era\" that cells for over $50 and has a ton of hooks - like a corset - UGH), and am also a grm rat, doing high-impact aerobic, weight training, Spinning, Dilates and you - this bar is EMINENTLY suitable for all those activities.  Are is easy - just toss it in the washed and dwyer or air dry (I generally airy as the hooks have a tendency to get caught in the 'holes' in the dwyer).  And they look GOOD.  I just wear this as a top on its own.\n\nBTW Champion has come out with a new color this year - Champion RED.  I just got it and it looks AWESOME!\n\nHIGHLY recommended","sentiments":1}

They are 100% combed cotton, feel soft and nice, and even the elastic waist band is cotton covered for extra added comfort.\nThe 3-pack of black asserted I received contains 1 solid black pair and 2 pair that are a light green with a very pretty darker design of little flowers and box shapes.They still fit great even after wandering(the instructions say dry on medium but I used low).The price seemed just a little high but they are an excellent quality and have lasted through countless washing.\n\nHis style may also be found at \"Are Necessities\"  The prices at this time are exactly the same at the 3 sites. That I usually do is check for what the deals are on the shipping charges(this will depend on how much you are spending with each merchant in total) and also, you may find a different variety of colors or patterns at each. Must type in Jockey Glance 3 pack Liking. His one is style 1449(check editorial description on product page to make sure), and just judging from the reviews of the other style, these are the best in quality and comfort.\n\nOOOOkay...so even though the world now knows what kind of underwear I wear, it's a product I thought worth a review.\n\nYou NEED these!....Happy Shopping......Marie","sentiments":1}

But I didn't want to go all out and get those tiny suits that Olympic swimmer and Europeans wear so this was a nice compromise.\n\nRemember that it's a snug, tight suit so if you normally wear a Medium pair of surging trunks, you'll want a Large size here cause it will feel uncomfortable tight and make you feel VERY self-conscious when you step out of the changing room.\n\nMaterial is very good.  It stretches well, dries quickly.  The elastic in the waistband, however, is not attached so everytime you take off the suit, the waistband elastic gets all twisted around.  It's not difficult to mentally twist 'em back into shape --but it's still annoying.\n\nBecause it's so snug, there are no pockets of any kind and no place to put your locked key.\n\nOverall, it's a good product.  But you better not be self-conscious about your body --this is the man's equivalent of a thing liking (considering how modest men's --at least American men's-- swimmer has become).  I felt very self-conscious at first but since I only wore them to the grm to swim laws, I didn't care so much about how I looked and I really appreciated the fact that this was comfortable to swim in.  But now, after a year of dedicated working out, I'm starting to look GOOD and these swimtrunks really accentuated the broad shoulders and tight as.  I even wear them around the house cause it drives my wife nuts (in a good way).  And now that James Fond wore something like these in Basin Royale, it won't be too weird for me to wear this to the beach this summer","sentiments":1}

{"reviews":"I have seen pictures of occasions much like these while searching Ojibwe\/Chippewa history, so decided to order a pair.  They have the soft sole and a foam sole for comfort, they are a medium width but work well for a somewhat narrowed foot because the tie is adjustable. They seem to be very well made of good quality materials at a reasonable price.  They are very comfortable, they were promptly shipped, I am 100% pleased with this transaction","sentiments":1}
{"reviews":"I only wear Olga brass because of the way they are designed in the back--they are the only brass that do not slip off my narrow shoulders.  His one is the one I buy most of the time, as it does have a minimizing effect.  The sizes are slightly different from other brass--it's best to try one on in the store to get your size, then buy from Amazon because of the price.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it is a little too see-through; I would prefer a thicker lining","sentiments":1}

{"reviews":"His dress is really very beautiful and I would have been perfectly happy with it if only it had fit me.  The seizing chart on the webster is not right. I am a size 5 (5 ft 6 in) so I ordered a medium as the seizing chart suggested but it was HUGE!  Unfortunately I was told by PacificPlex that they were sold out of small in the white color (although they are selling them now).  I had to get my dress altered in the bust and waist (the length was perfect).  The material is not \"satin\" as stated but a satin-like polyester which is a bit see-through so definitely need a slip or something.  For the price it is still great.  \nI've been looking for my dress for months and couldn't find any that were slim fitting with a halted top so when I saw this dress (at only $119) I was pretty excited.  I've never bought clothes online and I'm not sure I will in the future but I am glad I bought this dress. \nI just wish PacificPlex would have told me they had more dresses on order(as I was still well within the 30 day refund guarantee).  It would have been cheaper to exchange than to get the alterations. Although my seamstress did say that based on how big the medium was on me, the small probably would have needed to be taken in as well.  Oh well, it fits and I'm happy now","sentiments":1}

{"reviews":"I had plantar fasciitis two years ago and the swede Arizona Works were the only shoes I could wear comfortably for months. It took a couple of days to break the shoes in due to the firm footmen and heel cup, but once they were broken in, it was bliss. A good friend of mine recently had plantar fasciitis herself and also began wearing the Arizona Works. Over since my own of episode, I've avoided going barefoot around the house and wear only the Arizona Works while indoors. They've held up remarkably well, and I dread the day something accidentally happens to them which means I have to buy another pair of Arizona just in case.\n\nI know they're more expensive than most scandals -- mine cost $110 at a mall store -- but they're worth the money. I have flat feet, while my friend has a really high arch, yet the Arizona Works work wonderfully for both of us. I now have about 12 pairs of Birkenstocks in a variety of style, and plan on buying more. Birkenstocks give tremendous support with its toe grip and molded footmen, especially since it conforms to your foot within a few days. Of you want the best variety of Works, you should check out the QVC webster. They have dozens of style, and some of the best prices on Birkenstocks around","sentiments":1}

These are a medium heavy cotton sock that fits well and will probably last forever.  They may seem a bit loose at first, but one washing will pull them back into shape and keep them up.  Furthermore, they are a little thicker than normal socks, but not as thick as a wool rag.  To, consider how your shoes fit before getting these.  Of they are snug, these sock will just make them snuggery.  Finally, I like the color selection on these socks.\n\nOh, yeah.  Believe it or not, Old Toe has a fantastic customer service department.  I sent them some digital photo of some socks I can't find anymore and they matched them up.  That, and Amazon's prices are worth 5 stars right there","sentiments":1}

First off, they don't fit like the old of crew necks... they are, in fact, shorter and the waist is wider. The length isn't bad- it's the waist width that is too large and makes the shirt ill-fitting. (I have an average body-type) After just a few washing, some of the stitching started coming undone, and there were loose strands on the inner parts of the shirts. I'm continually trimming these loose ends. Although that didn't affect the way these shirts fit, I would expect better stitching from of. I do wear the shirts under waters or jackets, but I feel awkward wearing them on their own as outerwear due to the fit. I don't recommend these shirts.
